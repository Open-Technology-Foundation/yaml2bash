      Applied anthropology is the practical application of anthropological theories,
      methods, and practices to the analysis and solution of practical problems. The
      term was first put forward by Daniel G. Brinton in his paper \"The Aims of Anthropology\".
      \[ 1 \] John Van Willengen defined applied anthropology as \"anthropology put
      to use\". \[ 2 \] Applied anthropology includes conducting research with a primary
      or tertiary purpose to solve real-world problems in areas such as public health,
      education, government, and business.


      In Applied Anthropology: Domains of Application , Kedia and Van Willigen define
      the process as a \"complex of related, research-based, instrumental methods
      which produce change or stability in specific cultural systems through the provision
      of data, initiation of direct action, and/or the formulation of policy\". \[
      3 \] In other words, applied anthropology is the praxis-based side of anthropological
      research; it includes researcher involvement and activism within the participating
      community .


      ## Spanning academic disciplines


      The American Anthropological Association (AAA) website describes anthropology
      as a focus on \"the study of humans, past and present. To understand the full
      sweep and complexity of cultures across all of human history, anthropology draws
      and builds upon knowledge from the social and biological sciences as well as
      the humanities and physical sciences.\" Thus, the field of anthropology encompasses
      four subareas: sociocultural anthropology , biological (or physical) anthropology
      , archaeology , and linguistic anthropology . \[ 4 \] Because a central tenet
      of the anthropological field is the application of shared knowledge and research
      about humans across the world, an anthropologist who specializes in any of these
      areas and enacts research into direct action and/or policy can be deemed an
      \"applied anthropologist\". In fact, some practical, real-world problems invoke
      all sub-disciplines of anthropological theory, method, and practice. For example,
      a Native American community development program may involve archaeological research
      to determine legitimacy of water rights claims, ethnography to assess the current
      and historical cultural characteristics of the community, linguistics to restore
      language competence among inhabitants, and medical anthropology to determine
      the causality of dietary deficiency diseases.


      ## Professional engagement


      Applied anthropologists often work for nonacademic clients, such as governments
      , development agencies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), tribal and ethnic
      associations, advocacy groups , social-service and educational agencies, and
      businesses. It is also not uncommon for an anthropologist to initiate activist
      work surrounding his or her own area of study; frequently, sociocultural anthropological
      studies begin as mere research inquiries that blossom into community advocacy
      projects, and even new specialized NGOs. \[ 5 \] \[ 6 \]


      Methodology utilized in applied anthropology includes, but is not limited to,
      ethnography , participant observation , snowballing , interviews, and focus
      groups . Applied anthropologists also use textual analysis , surveying, archival
      research , and other empirical methods to inform policy or to market products.


      ## Problems and criticisms


      The process of conducting anthropological research and then applying knowledge
      in attempts to improve the lives of research participants can be problematic,
      and is often laced with elements of Orientalism and/or colonialism . \[ 7 \]
      Kedia and Van Willigen describe the moral dilemma embedded in this work: \"The
      ethical requirements of applied anthropology are especially challenging since
      the practitioner must negotiate an intricate balance between the interests of
      the clients who commission the work, and those of the community being studied.\"
      The authors continue by stating that this negotiation leads to issues of privacy,
      ownership, and the implications and purposes of the study being produced (p. 16).
      \[ 3 \]


      Although guidelines regarding ethicalities of applied anthropology are put forth
      by major anthropological organizations-including the American Anthropological
      Association (AAA), the Society for Applied Anthropology (SFAA), and the National
      Association for the Practice of Anthropology (NAPA)-it is increasingly difficult
      to ensure that the high volume of worldwide anthropologists proceed with their
      research in ways that are both culturally relative and sensitive to community
      needs. Kedia and Van Willigen describe the myriad roles an applied anthropologist
      must play as effective resource for communities in need; a researcher must be
      an advocate, cultural \"broker\", evaluator, policy researcher, public participation
      specialist, and research analyst. \[ 3 \]


      There has also been some criticism of the interaction between applied anthropologists
      and government agencies, as those agencies may want to move forward with a development
      project while anthropologists restrict progress studying carefully before supporting
      the project. \[ 8 \]


      ### Debates about objectivity/cultural relativity in anthropology


      The field of anthropology is also fraught with debate surrounding accurate and
      effective approaches to conducting research. More specifically, there is continued
      debate about the essentiality of objectivity in anthropological fieldwork. Some
      hermeneutic scholars contend that it is impossible to remove one\''s own preconceived
      cultural notions from one\''s work. In this line of thought, it is more productive
      to recognize that anthropologists are themselves culturally programmed observers,
      and must always be wary of biases that influence information they receive. In
      contrast, the positivist approach to anthropology emphasizes the necessity for
      an objective, regimented, and scientific approach to anthropological research.
      \[ 9 \] \[ 10 \]


      The multinational phenomenon of female genital cutting (FGC) exemplifies the
      necessity for an anthropologist to account for relative cultural contexts: \"The
      work of scholars who stress the fundamental importance of offering perspectives
      on cultural factors that promote the practice of female genital cutting has
      brought the debate surrounding cultural relativism into sharp focus. Greunbaum
      (1996) notes that analyses that do offer emic interpretations and cultural contextualizations
      are often criticized as bordering on advocacy for the practice\" \[emphasis
      in original\]. \[ 11 \] In these instances, it is imperative that an anthropologist
      not cloud his or her own preconceived notions about health and gender relations
      in an attempt to \"remedy\" a complex social issue.


      ## Scholarly works and organizations


      There are three primary groups based in the US that are founded on the application
      of anthropology with acute attention to ethics and social implications: American
      Anthropological Association (AAA), Society for Applied Anthropology (SFAA),
      and the National Association for the Practice of Anthropology (NAPA).


      The premiere journal of applied anthropology in the United States is called
      Human Organization , published by the Society for Applied Anthropology. In the
      UK, the main journal for applied anthropology is called Anthropology in Action
      .


      The Association of Social Anthropologists (ASA) has a network of Applied Anthropologists
      known as \"Apply\". \[ 12 \] Within the European Association of Social Anthropologists
      (EASA), there is the Applied Anthropology Network, \[ 13 \] which annually organises
      the international symposium, Why the World Needs Anthropologists. The theme
      of the first symposium was New Fields for Applied Anthropology in Europe (Amsterdam,
      2013), followed by; Coming Out of the Ivory Tower (Padua, 2014), Burning Issues
      of Our Hot Planet (Ljubljana, 2015), Humanise IT (Tartu, 2016), Powering the
      Planet (Durham, 2017), and Designing the Future (Lisbon, 2018). Within the EASA
      Medical Anthropology Network, there is also an applied anthropology special
      interest group.


      Under the direction of the Royal Anthropological Institute , Jonathan Benthall
      (author of The Best of Anthropology Today ) created the annual Lucy Mair Medal
      of Applied Anthropology. This recognizes excellence in using anthropology \"for
      the relief of poverty or distress, or for the active recognition of human dignity\".

      # What is Applied Anthropology?


      Applied anthropology is simply \"anthropology put to use\" (to quote John Van
      Willigen). It is any kind of anthropological research that is done to solve
      practical problems. This means that there are stakeholders and clients who stand
      to gain or lose from the project.


      Anthropology can be used to solve problems in an enormous variety of fields.
      Here are some common examples:


      - Health and medicine

      - Business

      - Human rights

      - Education

      - Environmental issues

      - Community development

      - Museums

      - Disaster research &amp; management

      - International development


      Applied anthropologists can take on very different roles in their work. They
      may be one or more of the following:


      - Researchers

      - Policy analysts

      - Program evaluators

      - Needs assessors

      - Impact assessors

      - Community advocates

      - Trainers

      - Culture brokers

      - Managers

      - Change agents

      - Consultants


      To see the range of the work applied anthropologists do, you can look at the
      applied projects and interests of the faculty in UNT\''s anthropology program:


      - Faculty\''s Applied Interests and Consulting Specialties


      As you can see, applied anthropology is not just one kind of job. It can be
      many different things. What unites applied anthropologists is their perspective
      on the world. They are trained to look at societies holistically, to respect
      cultural differences, and to learn about social phenomena through a careful
      process of observation and interviewing. The flexibility of their possible career
      directions means that applied anthropologists often have a creative, entrepreneurial
      bent.


      There are two professional organizations for applied anthropology:


      - Society for Applied Anthropology

      - National Association for the Practice of Anthropology

      # What is Applied Anthropology?


      Sometimes called the \"fifth sub-field\", applied anthropology is simply defined
      as the use of anthropological knowledge and skills to solve real-world problems.
      Everything from implementing culturally appropriate medical interventions, to
      mediating between indigenous and conservationist stakeholders, to even designing
      better products that meet users\'' needs, anthropologists successfully take
      on unique roles while serving in the private, public, and non-governmental sectors.


      Anthropologists bring methods informed by a robust theoretical heritage that
      emphasize the importance of understanding locally-contextualized knowledge as
      well as the impacts of (pre)historical and social forces. Graduate-level training
      at the University of Memphis draws upon the diverse experience and expertise
      of faculty while remaining committed to locally-engaged and community-based
      research and practice. Our nationally recognized Graduate Program is one of
      the oldest Applied Anthropology programs in the US and is designed to train
      students to apply the theoretical and methodological foundations you learn in
      the classroom in professional settings.


      Some of our faculty strengths in applied anthropology include: - Medical Anthropology
      and Public Health - Community Development - Environmental Anthropology - Political
      Economy and Ecology - Race and Social Inequality - Qualitative and Quantitative
      Methodologies - Refugee, Migrant, and Immigrant populations - Environmental
      Justice and Activism - Food Systems and Insecurity


      Through the practicum experience, the MA in Applied Anthropology provides you
      with the opportunity to work directly with organizations who benefit from your
      unique knowledge and, in turn, give you real world experience in the community
      development, community health, and business arenas. The networks, knowledge,
      and experience you will build through this first hand learning is invaluable
      to your future employment prospects after graduating from our challenging, rewarding,
      and award winning program.'

      1\. Introduction


      Anthropology is the science of man which has two dimensions i.e. academic and
      applied. Applied anthropology has a wide range of scope. The knowledge of this
      discipline is used in traditional anthropology for contemporary social, economic,
      or health problems faced by communities or organizations. Applied anthropology
      also uses the knowledge from other spheres of anthropology in order to identify
      and solve many concrete cross-cultural problems. Applied anthropology, which
      is a sub branch of anthropology concerns with the main problems of cultural
      differences in a less susceptible and more lenient manner to satisfy human life
      across the world.


      Applied anthropologists ensure the survival of at-risk groups by drawing upon
      a wide array of research methods and theoretical approaches to endow individuals
      to jointly discourse the real world problems. Primarily anthropology is divided
      into four subfields viz. cultural, biological, archaeology, and linguistics
      but applied anthropology is also considered as a fifth subfield by many experts.
      They are reflecting the growth of the discipline in professional ground and
      scholarly activity. The importance of applied anthropology is indicated by the
      continuing debate within the discipline over it.


      1.1 : Concept of applied Anthropology


      The concept of applied anthropology was first put forward by Daniel G. Brinton
      (1895) in his paper "The aims of anthropology". According to him, "Applied anthropology
      aims accurately to ascertain what the criteria of civilization, what individual
      or social elements have in past contributed most to it, how these can be continued
      and strengthened and what new forces, if any, may be called in to hasten the
      progress". In 1987, Erve Chambbers stated, "applied anthropology is the field
      of inquiry concerned with the relationship between anthropological knowledge
      and the uses of that knowledge in the world beyond anthropology".


      This field was also used in colonial administrations for the first time by officials
      from some of the larger countries of Europe. They were not anthropologists in
      general but their work required them to gain knowledge for the needs and wishes
      of the native people. In this way, applied anthropology began its career with
      a debatable reputation. In the early twentieth century, the Ashanti people applied
      anthropology in solving their problems.


      2.   The domains of application


      2.1 Practitioners'' role in Anthropology


      Applied anthropologists are involved in many roles such as administrator, advisor,
      coordinator, consultant, archaeologist, supervisor, fieldworker etc. which are
      specified according to the tasks they are undertaking.


      Policy researcher


      Policy makers need information to make decisions on policies. In general, they
      are involved in many roles such as traditional ethnographic research or a variety
      of research techniques in particular areas. This role may be the most important
      and can be initiated at various stages of research process, which is from research
      design to data collection. All budding applied anthropologists need to have
      training as policy researchers as the research function is common to many applied
      aspects.


      Evaluator


      The role of evaluators in a policy research is very special. They evaluate the
      use of research skills to determine whether a project, program or policy is
      successful or the results are effective or not. The main task is to objectively
      determine the worth of something.


      Impact assessor


      It is one of the specialized policy research roles which involve the function
      such as the forecast of the effects of a project, program, or policy. An impact
      assessor generally endeavours to determine the effects of planned government
      projects which are close to the human communities. An impact assessor often
      studies various design substitutions because the information produced is usually
      envisioned to influence the design of a project.


      Needs assessor


      The gathering of data on public program which is needed in looking forward to
      social, health, economic and education program design is the role of need assessor
      in policy research. The process of program design and justification is contributed
      by needs assessor. Its role is more common and closely related to evaluation.


      Planner


      Anthropologists take part in the design of future policies, projects and programs
      as planners. In support of decision makers, they may involve in the collection
      of data and analysis of research. This is a unique role.


      Research analyst


      The role of research analyst is to interpret research results of various kinds
      for decision makers. The research analyst may serve as a supporter to planners,
      policy makers and program managers.


      Advocate


      Community groups and individuals are often supported by advocates. They play
      a complex role which always involves direct political action consistent with
      the community''s self-defined objectives. The role of advocacy is not common
      in itself but it may be part of other roles


      Trainer


      Applied anthropologists act as a role of trainers. They develop and use training
      materials referenced to a number of diverse content areas and client groups.
      They prepare technicians and tools for cross-cultural experiences.


      Culture broker


      The culture broker helps in making the link between programs and ethnic communities.
      This role is appeared to be more beneficial in the field of health care delivery
      and the establishment of social services. In addition to these, the culture
      brokerage is also attached to many other roles.


      Expert witness


      The expert witness works on a part-time basis which involves the presentation
      of research data through legal documents. This role is usually taken over by
      those who are academically employed.


      Public participation specialist


      The need for public input planning has developed a new role known as public
      participation specialist. It is somewhat similar to the role of culture broker,
      although it inclines to occur on a case-to-case basis rather than continuously
      as with culture brokerage. Involvement of anthropology in this role is increasing.


      Administrator


      Anthropologists are often engaged as administrators because practicing anthropologists
      proceed with their career. They have ordinance administrative responsibility
      for the programs within which they work. Being in charge in the agencies, some
      anthropologists have become very influential. The roles of administrators are
      usually not at entry-level.


      Change agent


      The change agent is part of a variety of other responsibilities and is a generalized
      functionary. They work to encourage change as they sometimes take the role to
      carry out as part of a specific strategy of change such as action anthropology
      and development anthropology.


      Therapist


      This is a quite rare role as it involves the use of anthropology along with
      the knowledge of various consultations therapies to treat individuals with various
      problems. They sometimes refer themselves as clinical anthropologists.


      3\. Development of applied anthropology


      Van Willigen (1986) traced the development of applied anthropology through five
      different stages. These are the pre-disciplinary stage, the applied ethnology
      stage, the federal service stage, the role-extension stage, value-explicit stage
      and the policy research stage. The growth of applied anthropology has established
      different range of tendencies. There is a parallel development of applied and
      theoretical aspects of discipline and the potentials of application are used
      as a foundation for the development of various academic programs and theoretical
      research programs.


      The stimulus of interest in new research areas and populations is a major effect
      of applied anthropology on theoretical anthropology. The development of applied
      anthropology is considered to be best in terms of an additive extension of research
      context, topics and techniques. The intervention techniques which have been
      developed in anthropology are not applied frequently today. Rather than considering
      applied anthropology as a reliable pattern of internally generated change, it
      should also be thought of as mainly a product of important external forces.


      4.   Scope of applied anthropology


      There is a wide range of scope of applied anthropology. They have their basic
      goals, the first one is to identify needs for change that local people observe,
      second is to design culturally appropriated change by working with those people,
      and finally to protect local people from harmful policies including destructive
      development schemes.


      4.1 Applied anthropology in good governance:


      The Americans and British took help from anthropology because it provided useful
      information in maintaining effective colonial rule. The confounded administrator
      and the dying Red Indian was rescued by anthropology after a long unsuccessful
      policy which uprooted and eradicated a large number of the native races of North
      America. John Collier, a commissioned officer took a big advancing step by linking
      anthropologist to start a better Indian''s policy in 1933. This step had become
      one of the progressive administrations which were based more on anthropological
      principles. Regular training in anthropology was given to those officers of
      the Dutch and the French who were accountable for the administration of their
      colonies prior to the British and the Americans.


      4.2 Development programmes:


      Applied anthropologists have initiated the study of human problems due to the
      variations in technology which are happening in all developing and developed
      countries. The problems of race have been solved by anthropologists by strongly
      convincing that the mental traits are not related to race. A few of them are
      psychotherapists who are employing the perceptions of the anthropologists like
      Gregory Bateson and others on family systems and family therapy.


      Others are working for the worldwide development by joining hands with the U.S.
      Agency for International Development and the United States Department of Agriculture.
      They are concerned with the appropriate technology, fuel wood shortages, agricultural
      credit, new land development, feasibility studies for dams, livestock improvement,
      bilingual education etc. The significance of anthropologists for the development
      programmes have become familiar only when there is a consistent failure of the
      project planners because they neglect the cultural dimensions of development.
      Anthropologists have increased equality in the distribution of wealth and also
      help in reducing the rate of poverty by filling up the gap between a plan and
      the local socio-cultural pattern of the targeted area.


      4.3 Education and anthropology:


      The work of educational anthropologists involves in classrooms, homes, neighbourhood
      and other settings relevant to education. Anthropologists are often interested
      and involved with various aspects of education. They regard children as total
      cultural being whose enculturation and attitudes toward education belong to
      an environment which includes family and peers. Policy recommendations on education
      are led through this applied research.


      4.4 Urban life and anthropology:


      Urban anthropologists also study the life in city, and urbanization. Applied
      anthropologists propose, design and implement social policy and pay attention
      to social forms and to urban social units. For controlling demographic trends,
      food habits and social change, applied anthropologists also study value - attitude
      systems.


      4.5 Medical system:


      Applied medical anthropologists deal with the diseases and the factors responsible
      for them. They are involved in examining the disease affecting different population,
      socially constructed illness and treatment of illness in effective and culturally
      accepted ways. The spread and distribution of diseases and the influence of
      cultural pattern are mainly examined by those who are specially focussed on
      epidemiology.


      The popularity in contemporary North America is mainly due to the combination
      of methods used in treatment of whole being which are proved beneficial that
      is holistic medicine in the medical system. Using a combination of therapies
      which include elements of ritual, magic and modern scientific medications instead
      of relying only on any single therapeutic approach is common even among urban-educated
      elite.


      4.6 Gerontology:


      Research on ageing in different cultures and designing programmes for elderly
      in gerontology also involved contributions by applied anthropologists. They
      focus on the consequences of the society where the value of youth is admired
      and the increase in number of elderly people to be regarded as problematic.


      4.7 Business and anthropology:


      Anthropology is also applied in business in some key aspects which include ethnography
      and observation as ways of gathering data, cross-cultural expertise and focus
      on cultural diversity. The relationship between labour and employer has also
      been studied to decrease tensions which generally exist between various classes.
      In a common social system, different social manager, executives and workers
      may be categorized as different social groups. People in the society learn specific
      roles in their limited social system through the process of micro-enculturation.


      4.8 Anthropology in sports or Kinanthropometry


      The work kinanthropometry or sports anthropometry is derived from the Greek
      words, kineein means to move, anthropos means human and metreein means to measure.
      It is defined as the application of measurement to the study of human size,
      shape, proportion, composition, maturation and gross function. The application
      areas of this field are used by sports scientist, coaches, physical educationists,
      paediatricians, human biologists etc. In kinanthropometry,the techniques of
      taking various body measurements such as height, weight, diameters, circumferences,
      skinfold thicknesses etc. are equipped to understand human body structure and
      function. Selection of players for various events is done by anthropologists
      through the knowledge of anthropometry.


      4.9 Forensic anthropology


      The application of the science of physical anthropology to the legal process
      is often termed as forensic anthropology. For many reasons such as humanitarian,
      legal etc., identification of human remains, skeletal or badly decomposed body
      is important. Under these situations, forensic anthropologists play very ideal
      role. They used many standard scientific techniques developed in physical anthropology
      to identify remains of human beings and to assist legal officers in crime investigation.


      They also work jointly with forensic odontologists, pathologists and homicide
      investigators to detect a decedent, discover evidence of foul play and the post-mortem
      interval. Not only this, they are also able to suggest the age, sex, ethnicity,
      stature and unique features of the suspicious remains'' decedent. Thus, the
      application of forensic anthropology is immensely beneficial for the scientific
      community as well as for the welfare of the society by reconstructing the past
      events and also helps in justification of the events.

      5.   Applied anthropology in India:


      Applied anthropology plays an important role in India. The contribution of anthropologists
      is needed in the policy of internal reconstruction on social and economic fronts.
      It was realized in 1807 that the knowledge of anthropology for smooth running
      of administration is important when the Board of Directors of the East India
      Company made a formal decision to use it in administration. Francis Buchnon
      was selected to commence an ethnographic survey of Bengal. Since then Risley,
      Dalton, Grierson, Gurdon and many others had been allotted to prepare handbooks,
      gazetteers, monographs, etc. on tribes and castes of India.


      In the early period of census survey, their services were also employed. The
      various problems of the Adivasis and Harijans were highlighted by anthropologists
      like Mazumdar, Dube, Chattopadyay, Vidyarthi etc. and they also recommended
      ways and means to upgrade their socio-economic conditions. Thus, anthropologists
      are supportive in framing policies for the welfare of tribes and castes. Anthropologists
      can do great justice to the tasks of rewriting the reports on tribes and castes
      with the scientific training and skill. The study of generalized value-attitude
      systems can also be helped by anthropologists. The knowledge of anthropologists
      could be long-lasting in progressing the best ways of checking the alarming
      population growth which threatens to upset all our planning and development
      schemes.


      Applied anthropologists have also taken part in other areas other than tribal
      and backward sections. B.C. Agarwal and his band of young and many other devoted
      anthropologists have conducted a founding work for The Space Application Centre,
      Ahmedabad to develop social research plan of programme production for telecasting.
      Satellite Television Experiment (SITE) was one of the largest and progressive
      experiments conducted on human communication and in this type of experiment
      anthropologists contributed depth, qualitative and descriptive knowledge for
      understanding the process of communication.


      Anthropologists are very concerned about many crises of survival in which human
      beings are suffering and anthropologists do not overlook such crises. A number
      of commissions such as Commissions on Urban Anthropology to work on urgent anthropological
      research, on women issues, on food and food problems and on the challenges of
      development have been established by the International Union of Anthropological
      and Ethnological Sciences (IUAES) in response to these crises. Further, in order
      to face major challenges of Indian society, India has also induced such practical
      concerns of relevant anthropology, urgent anthropology, etc.


      6\. Uniqueness of applied anthropology:


      One of the most valuable research tools of applied anthropology is ethnography.
      Anthropologists study the cross-cultural perspective. The perfection in this
      branch of anthropology is mainly due to its holistic characteristics. In development
      works, applied anthropologists take the \`clinical'' or \`engineering'' roles.
      The decision making tools, including reagent information concerning the probable
      consequences of alternative possible choices are provided by clinical anthropologists
      to the client who may be an administrator or a citizen group.


      However, formulation of specific recommendations for the clients is the role
      of engineering anthropologists. Some of those anthropologists were Raymond Firth
      who was more like a doctor who advises rather than like an engineer who builds
      whereas the anthropologists such as Nadel have a preference on social engineering
      as the proper approach of applied anthropology.


      Summary


      Applied anthropology has played a very crucial role in diverse areas. Different
      stages have gone through to develop this aspect. Many expert applied anthropologists
      can take the roles in many fields such as in administration, education, sports,
      crime scene investigation, business etc. In the present context, applied anthropology
      is involved in solving numerous problems and crises. They also help in developing
      the welfare of the tribal groups and many others such as in development of urban
      areas by setting up policies and plans etc. Applied anthropologists are helpful
      in upbringing the future life of the society from different perspectives. In
      effective and good governance, many administrative norms are applied by using
      the basic principles of anthropology. Various rules and regulations recommended
      in educational centres through the applied research of anthropology as they
      investigate the basic traits of the learners which have been encultured or diffused.
      The field of medical anthropology helps a lot at the population level by probing
      the diseases and the factors responsible for it. The problems of elderly are
      also rendered and managed by the study of gerontology which is also a part of
      anthropology. Many ethnographic data collected by the anthropologist help in
      developing and bearing the workers in business. Identifying and selection of
      players in different field of sports usually take help from kinanthropologist
      because they know the relation of body physique with the person''s ability to
      perform in that particular event. Forensic anthropologists play a major role
      in crime scene investigation and paternity disputes investigation. There is
      development of the field of applied anthropology in India too. The scope of
      this aspect of anthropology is very wide that it has supported in many forthcomings
      way of life.

      Applied anthropology is the practical application of anthropological theories,
      methods, and practices to the analysis and solution of practical problems. The
      term was first put forward by Daniel G. Brinton in his paper \"The Aims of Anthropology\".
      \[ 1 \] John Van Willengen defined applied anthropology as \"anthropology put
      to use\". \[ 2 \] Applied anthropology includes conducting research with a primary
      or tertiary purpose to solve real-world problems in areas such as public health,
      education, government, and business.


      In Applied Anthropology: Domains of Application , Kedia and Van Willigen define
      the process as a \"complex of related, research-based, instrumental methods
      which produce change or stability in specific cultural systems through the provision
      of data, initiation of direct action, and/or the formulation of policy\". \[
      3 \] In other words, applied anthropology is the praxis-based side of anthropological
      research; it includes researcher involvement and activism within the participating
      community .


      ## Spanning academic disciplines


      The American Anthropological Association (AAA) website describes anthropology
      as a focus on \"the study of humans, past and present. To understand the full
      sweep and complexity of cultures across all of human history, anthropology draws
      and builds upon knowledge from the social and biological sciences as well as
      the humanities and physical sciences.\" Thus, the field of anthropology encompasses
      four subareas: sociocultural anthropology , biological (or physical) anthropology
      , archaeology , and linguistic anthropology . \[ 4 \] Because a central tenet
      of the anthropological field is the application of shared knowledge and research
      about humans across the world, an anthropologist who specializes in any of these
      areas and enacts research into direct action and/or policy can be deemed an
      \"applied anthropologist\". In fact, some practical, real-world problems invoke
      all sub-disciplines of anthropological theory, method, and practice. For example,
      a Native American community development program may involve archaeological research
      to determine legitimacy of water rights claims, ethnography to assess the current
      and historical cultural characteristics of the community, linguistics to restore
      language competence among inhabitants, and medical anthropology to determine
      the causality of dietary deficiency diseases.


      ## Professional engagement


      Applied anthropologists often work for nonacademic clients, such as governments
      , development agencies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), tribal and ethnic
      associations, advocacy groups , social-service and educational agencies, and
      businesses. It is also not uncommon for an anthropologist to initiate activist
      work surrounding his or her own area of study; frequently, sociocultural anthropological
      studies begin as mere research inquiries that blossom into community advocacy
      projects, and even new specialized NGOs. \[ 5 \] \[ 6 \]


      Methodology utilized in applied anthropology includes, but is not limited to,
      ethnography , participant observation , snowballing , interviews, and focus
      groups . Applied anthropologists also use textual analysis , surveying, archival
      research , and other empirical methods to inform policy or to market products.


      ## Problems and criticisms


      The process of conducting anthropological research and then applying knowledge
      in attempts to improve the lives of research participants can be problematic,
      and is often laced with elements of Orientalism and/or colonialism . \[ 7 \]
      Kedia and Van Willigen describe the moral dilemma embedded in this work: \"The
      ethical requirements of applied anthropology are especially challenging since
      the practitioner must negotiate an intricate balance between the interests of
      the clients who commission the work, and those of the community being studied.\"
      The authors continue by stating that this negotiation leads to issues of privacy,
      ownership, and the implications and purposes of the study being produced (p. 16).
      \[ 3 \]


      Although guidelines regarding ethicalities of applied anthropology are put forth
      by major anthropological organizations-including the American Anthropological
      Association (AAA), the Society for Applied Anthropology (SFAA), and the National
      Association for the Practice of Anthropology (NAPA)-it is increasingly difficult
      to ensure that the high volume of worldwide anthropologists proceed with their
      research in ways that are both culturally relative and sensitive to community
      needs. Kedia and Van Willigen describe the myriad roles an applied anthropologist
      must play as effective resource for communities in need; a researcher must be
      an advocate, cultural \"broker\", evaluator, policy researcher, public participation
      specialist, and research analyst. \[ 3 \]


      There has also been some criticism of the interaction between applied anthropologists
      and government agencies, as those agencies may want to move forward with a development
      project while anthropologists restrict progress studying carefully before supporting
      the project. \[ 8 \]


      ### Debates about objectivity/cultural relativity in anthropology


      The field of anthropology is also fraught with debate surrounding accurate and
      effective approaches to conducting research. More specifically, there is continued
      debate about the essentiality of objectivity in anthropological fieldwork. Some
      hermeneutic scholars contend that it is impossible to remove one\''s own preconceived
      cultural notions from one\''s work. In this line of thought, it is more productive
      to recognize that anthropologists are themselves culturally programmed observers,
      and must always be wary of biases that influence information they receive. In
      contrast, the positivist approach to anthropology emphasizes the necessity for
      an objective, regimented, and scientific approach to anthropological research.
      \[ 9 \] \[ 10 \]


      The multinational phenomenon of female genital cutting (FGC) exemplifies the
      necessity for an anthropologist to account for relative cultural contexts: \"The
      work of scholars who stress the fundamental importance of offering perspectives
      on cultural factors that promote the practice of female genital cutting has
      brought the debate surrounding cultural relativism into sharp focus. Greunbaum
      (1996) notes that analyses that do offer emic interpretations and cultural contextualizations
      are often criticized as bordering on advocacy for the practice\" \[emphasis
      in original\]. \[ 11 \] In these instances, it is imperative that an anthropologist
      not cloud his or her own preconceived notions about health and gender relations
      in an attempt to \"remedy\" a complex social issue.


      ## Scholarly works and organizations


      There are three primary groups based in the US that are founded on the application
      of anthropology with acute attention to ethics and social implications: American
      Anthropological Association (AAA), Society for Applied Anthropology (SFAA),
      and the National Association for the Practice of Anthropology (NAPA).


      The premiere journal of applied anthropology in the United States is called
      Human Organization , published by the Society for Applied Anthropology. In the
      UK, the main journal for applied anthropology is called Anthropology in Action
      .


      The Association of Social Anthropologists (ASA) has a network of Applied Anthropologists
      known as \"Apply\". \[ 12 \] Within the European Association of Social Anthropologists
      (EASA), there is the Applied Anthropology Network, \[ 13 \] which annually organises
      the international symposium, Why the World Needs Anthropologists. The theme
      of the first symposium was New Fields for Applied Anthropology in Europe (Amsterdam,
      2013), followed by; Coming Out of the Ivory Tower (Padua, 2014), Burning Issues
      of Our Hot Planet (Ljubljana, 2015), Humanise IT (Tartu, 2016), Powering the
      Planet (Durham, 2017), and Designing the Future (Lisbon, 2018). Within the EASA
      Medical Anthropology Network, there is also an applied anthropology special
      interest group.


      Under the direction of the Royal Anthropological Institute , Jonathan Benthall
      (author of The Best of Anthropology Today ) created the annual Lucy Mair Medal
      of Applied Anthropology. This recognizes excellence in using anthropology \"for
      the relief of poverty or distress, or for the active recognition of human dignity\".

      This article explores the subject of applied anthropology. It was found to be
      most productive to do this from a historical perspective in order to see the
      formation of the discipline from its earliest, inchoate form to its current
      state. This method lends a processual understanding of how applied anthropology
      arrived at the state in which it is found in early 21st century anthropology.


      The article commences with a brief definition of applied anthropology in both
      its broader and more restrictive senses. What follows then is an examination
      of the origins of applied anthropology within the matrix of anthropology, generally,
      in the 19th century. The early history of the discipline through the post-World
      War II, or mid-20th century, era is explored in the next section. The mid-20th-century
      era was dominated by three subjects: the Fox Project, the Peru Vicos Project,
      and Project Camelot, which is treated separately. The section on the later 20th
      century leads into applied anthropology today, which is followed by a section
      on areas for future research.


      Without doubt, some readers will question why particular topics are not presented
      in this article. To them, the reply is that some subjects were considered to
      be just as easily, and perhaps more fully. In other cases, the sections were
      perceived as becoming too large to the point of confusing the discussions. In
      some cases, articles published in some applied anthropology journals did not
      appear to do anything but describe situations without offering practical, applied
      solutions. It is hoped that this interpretation will not be taken personally
      by any authors or other scholars.


      ## What is Applied Anthropology?


      Applied anthropology, in its broader sense, is distinguished primarily from
      academic anthropology as anthropological methods and data put to use outside
      of the classroom. This is not to say that all anthropological methods and data
      put to use outside of the classroom is applied anthropology; field research
      also is anthropological methods and data put to use outside of the classroom,
      but it can be used for academic purposes, as well as for practical application.
      Applied anthropology is used to solve practical problems outside of the academic
      world, and it has appeared under such names as action anthropology, development
      anthropology, practicing anthropology, and advocacy anthropology among others.


      In its narrower sense, applied anthropology is distinguished from practicing
      anthropology. Practicing anthropology is the application of anthropology strictly
      outside of academia by nonacademics; applied anthropology can be practiced outside
      of academia or within academia by academics. To some, the differences are considered
      to be minimal, but to others they are of great importance.


      ## Origins of Applied Anthropology


      Early in the 19th century, anthropology was a religious philosophy that examined
      how to view the place of humans in the cosmos. This began to change by the mid-19th
      century, and people who were to become the founders of what is called anthropology
      today began to look at the more earthly nature of humanity. One of these individuals
      was Lewis Henry Morgan. Morgan, who was an attorney, began to work with the
      Iroquois in the 1840s on legal issues involving railroad right of ways. This
      may have been one of the first, if not the first, application of the nascent
      but as yet still inchoate discipline.


      Across the Atlantic, Sir Edward BurnettTylor, the "father of anthropology" who
      defined "culture," considered anthropology to be a "policy science" that should
      be implemented to ameliorate the problems of humanity. James Hunt, who founded
      the Anthropological Society of London, began to use the term practical anthropology
      by the 1860s, and in 1869, the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain
      and Ireland (this was later to be titled the Royal Anthropological Institute)
      was formed.


      In North America, the federal government formed the Bureau of American Ethnology
      (BAE) under John Wesley Powell in order to perform research that was intended
      to guide government policy toward Native Americans, and in 1879, Powell dispatched
      Frank Hamilton Cushing to the Zuñi pueblo to perform some of the first anthropological
      field research. By 1895, the BAE had hired anthropologist James Mooney to research
      a revitalization movement, the ghost dance. It also was in the 1890s that Franz
      Boas, the "father of American anthropology," worked outside of academia with
      the Chicago Field Museum.


      ## Early History of Applied Anthropology


      Boas developed a lifelong hatred of racism arising from anti-Semitic experiences
      he had had in school in Germany. This led him to attempt to dispel the prevailing
      racist notions of the day in anthropology. From 1910 to 1913, Boas applied anthropometry
      to disprove a basic racist assumption: Cranial shape was a factor of race. To
      accomplish this, he measured the heads of Jewish immigrants in New York City
      ghettos. Presumably, they were members of the dolichocephalic (long-headed)
      Mediterranean race, and indeed, the immigrants tended to fit that pattern. However,
      their children, born in America, were members of the brachicephalic (round-headed)
      Alpine race. Apparently, they had changed race within one generation of having
      moved to America. Boas explained this anomaly as being the product of different
      diets between the parents and their children during their growth years and not
      the result of race at all.


      Boas''s first PhD student, Alfred Louis Kroeber, and Kroeber''s students spent
      the first two decades of the 20th century conducting "salvage ethnology" to
      preserve cultures that were, or already had, become extinct. The most famous
      of these cases, both within and outside of anthropology, is the story of Ishi,
      the last member of the California Yahi tribe, whom Kroeber brought to Berkeley
      to serve as the key respondent from a vanished people. In 1919, Kroeber applied
      anthropological techniques to discover the rapprochement between fashion and
      economic cycles in his hem-length study. He demonstrated that one could determine
      (and perhaps predict) economic cycles by the rise or fall of women''s dress
      and skirt lengths. The 1920s also found Margaret Mead (1928/1973) making recommendations
      on sex education to the American educational establishment in the last two chapters
      of her doctoral dissertation, published as Coming of Age in Samoa.


      In Europe, it was common during this time for anthropologists to seek employment
      in colonial governments: Anthropologists from the Netherlands were employed
      by their government to provide ethnographic data on its Indonesian colony; Northcote
      Thomas used anthropology to aid in administrating the British colony in Nigeria;
      and Alfred Reginald Radcliffe-Brown served as director of education on Tonga.
      Somewhat later, in the 1930s, Edward Evan Evans-Pritchard (1969), in the employment
      of the government of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, spent several research periods
      among the Nuer to determine why they did not consider it necessary to uphold
      their treaty with the British government, among other projects. Also in the
      1930s, Radcliffe-Brown first used the term applied anthropology in the article
      "Anthropology as Public Service and Malinowski''s Contribution to It" (although
      the term already had appeared in 1906 in a degree program at Oxford). Bronislaw
      Malinowski himself, had coined the term practicing anthropology for nonacademic
      anthropology.


      In 1932, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt appointed the anthropologist John
      Collier to Commissioner of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). Collier then
      employed fellow anthropologists Julian Steward, Clyde Kluckhohn, and others
      in the applied anthropology office to investigate Native American cultures and
      to counsel the BIA in regard to the Indian Reorganization Act. The anthropologists
      served as intermediaries between the BIA and Native Americans during the drawing
      of tribal constitutions and charters. Also in the 1930s, Edward Sapir''s student,
      Benjamin Lee Whorf, applied anthropological linguists to the analysis of fire
      insurance investigations, and anthropologist W. Lloyd Warner was hired by the
      Western Electric Company to study worker productivity in its bank-wiring facility.
      Warner employed qualitative ethnographic techniques, such as participant observation
      and informal interviewing, that previously had been used in nonindustrial, non-Western
      societies in one of the first applications of "industrial anthropology."


      The 1940s brought about the efflorescence of the field with the founding of
      the Society for Applied Anthropology (SfAA) by Margaret Mead, Conrad Arensberg,
      and Eliot Chapple. They published the journal Applied Anthropology to counter
      what they saw as academic bias against practical, nontheoretical work. In 1949,
      the name of the journal was changed to Human Organization, and the SfAA code
      of ethics was created. Despite this, Melville Herskovits taught in the late
      1940s that applied anthropology was racist and should not be practiced, according
      to one of his former students.


      Today, a variety of organizations specialize in applied anthropology. The Consortium
      of Practicing and Applied Anthropology Programs (COPAA), chaired by Linda A.
      Bennett of the University of Memphis, lists and gives a brief description of
      some of these organizations on its Web site, including the COPAA , the SfAA
      , and the National Association for the Practice of Anthropology within the American
      Anthropological Association .


      The COPAA also lists regional organizations, which include the Washington Association
      of Professional Anthropologists; the High Plains Society for Applied Anthropology;
      the Chicago Association for Practicing Anthropologists; the Sun Coast Organization
      of Practicing Anthropologists; the California Alliance of Local Practitioner
      Organizations that embraces the Southern California Applied Anthropology Network,
      the Bay Area Association of Practicing Anthropologists, and the Central Valley
      Applied Anthropology Network; and the Mid-South Association of Professional
      Anthropologists. It was during World War II that Margaret Mead headed a group
      of anthropologists who served in the Office of Strategic Services. In addition
      to Mead, Ruth Benedict, Ralph Linton, Julian Steward, and Clyde Kluckhohn, among
      others (including such interdisciplinary notables as Erik Erikson), worked on
      the Committee on Food Habits, the Culture at a Distance national character project,
      theWar Relocation Authority, and others, in order to aid in the U.S. war effort.
      A description of their work and methods was published (Mead &amp; Rhoda, 1949)
      after the war as The Study of Culture at a Distance. Following the war, anthropologists
      also worked for the U.S. Pacific protectorates'' administrations.


      ## Applied Anthropology in the Mid-20th Century


      ### The Fox Project


      In the late 1940s, Sol Tax of the University of Chicago wanted to develop a
      program that would give field experience to anthropology students. To do this,
      he began the Fox Project in 1948 to look into social organization and leadership
      in the Fox/Tama settlement, which was facing acculturative pressures from the
      neighboring Euro-American community. Although they tried to become involved
      in the amelioration of the acculturative process, they had no authority to do
      so. Thus, they developed a theoretical agenda that became known as "action anthropology."
      In 1953, the group consulted with the Fox project and developed a framework
      for action that was funded by a private foundation. University of Iowa students
      joined the University of Chicago group, and together they created the Fox Indian
      Educational Program and began the Tama Indian Crafts industry.


      About the time that the Fox project was nearing its completion in 1952, Edward
      Spicer''s book, Human Problems in Technological Change, was published. That
      same year Allen Holmberg began Cornell University''s 14-year experiment: the
      "Peru Vicos Project." Cornell University had rented Vicos, a feudal estate in
      Peru, as a living laboratory to study social engineering on the Quechua-speaking
      peasantry, to test theories of modernization, and to develop models for community
      advocacy and culture brokering.


      ### 1964: Project Camelot


      Project Camelot had the potential to be a low point in the application of anthropology
      in the late 20th century. In December 1964, the Office of the Director of the
      Special Operations Research Office of the American University in Washington,
      D.C., announced a new program to be funded by the army and the Department of
      Defense. The program extensively would employ anthropological fieldworkers in
      government research for 3 to 4 years. In theory, it was a project that was intended
      to develop a systems model that would enable the prediction of social changes
      that in turn could develop into political movements in third world nations that
      might threaten the United States-specifically in Latin American countries (where
      a field office was planned) but with plans to expand globally. Its objectives
      were to formulate means to predict civil wars and revolutions; to identify means
      to prevent civil wars, insurgency, and counterinsurgency movements in particular
      societies; and to develop a system of field methods to collect the information
      to accomplish the two previous objectives. The budget was expected to be in
      the \$1.5 million range annually.


      Some anthropologists feared that applying anthropology to aid Latin American
      government''s repression of political movements was unethical and would hinder
      development of societies in those countries. A more horrific potential outcome
      to the field ethnographers was the possible executions of their field respondents.
      In response to the outcry from the social science community, Project Camelot
      was cancelled in July 1965.


      Nonetheless, not all social scientists found Project Camelot to be totally objectionable.
      Beyond the satisfaction of the obvious and never-ending quest for research funding,
      which it would have provided, albeit from sources that are suspect to many in
      the academic community, there is the less obvious appeal of ethnography finally
      having some input into government international policy, something that had been
      called for over decades. Likewise, many anthropologists in that era had gotten
      their starts in the military by having had their first international experiences
      during the second World War and their educations financed by the government
      issue, or GI, Bill. Rather, it was the possible outcomes of their research that
      convinced the community to object to Project Camelot.


      Also in the 1960s, medical anthropologists working with the Foré tribe of New
      Guinea traced the origins of a deadly neurological disease, kuru, to cannibalism
      by using traditional qualitative techniques, such as collecting life histories;
      Margaret Mead testified before Congress on birth control and marijuana, and
      she coined the term generation gap to describe a global phenomenon that had
      never occurred previously in human history; Jules Henry''s Culture Against Man
      described the Orwellian nature of popular advertising in American society; Jomo
      Kenyatta applied his PhD in anthropology from the London School of Economics
      under Malinowski to running the government of Kenya, with its diverse ethnic
      makeup, as its first president under the slogan Harambe, or "let us pull together"
      in Kiswahili. Oscar Lewis conducted his "family life histories" in Mexico City
      (The Children of Sanchez) and New York (La Vida) and described the poor as living
      in a selfperpetuating "culture of poverty." Although this was criticized widely
      as an attempt to blame the poor for their condition, it also could be said that
      Lewis was acknowledging the wisdom of people who lived on the edge and their
      ability to survive and fully exploit their economic niches.


      James P. Spradley conducted a Herculean application of ethnoscience to "tramp"
      culture in Seattle in the 1960s to determine the emic structure of the society
      in order to make recommendations for improved treatments to social workers,
      police, psychiatrists, and alcohol treatment centers. It was published as You
      Owe Yourself a Drunk: An Ethnography of Urban Nomads in 1970. In 1969, George
      Foster wrote the first textbook on development and change agency, Applied Anthropology,
      in which he cited changes in human behavior as a primary goal in order to solve
      social, economic, and technological problems. He followed this up in 1973 with
      Traditional Societies and Technological Change.


      ## Applied Anthropology in the Late 20th Century


      In 1974, the University of South Florida began the first master of arts degree
      program to focus specifically on training students for careers in applied anthropology.
      The options available to those students form a wide range of topics that define
      applied anthropology. Among them are archaeology, Cultural Resource Management,
      economic development, educational anthropology, immigration, medical anthropology,
      race, gender, ethnicity, and urban policy and community development. Among the
      reasons for such theoretical breadth is the realization that many master of
      arts students do not choose to pursue a doctor of philosophy degree, and this
      curriculum, then, qualifies them to work in specialized professions outside
      of academia. The reader will note that work outside of academia is known as
      practicing anthropology, and in 1978 the University of South Florida first published
      the journal Practicing Anthropology. Graduate programs in applied anthropology
      are becoming more widespread in the United States since that time; for example,
      the master''s program in applied anthropology at California State University,
      Long Beach, has three program options: communities/ organizations, health, and
      education. Northern Kentucky University''s anthropology program is long known
      for its award-winning Web site with information on where undergraduate anthropology
      majors, who cannot or do not choose to attend graduate programs, can find jobs
      outside of academia; currently, it is in the process of developing a master''s
      program in applied anthropology.


      ## Programs in Applied Anthropology


      COPAA lists member programs on its Web site for those interested in pursuing
      a career in applied anthropology. The Web site notes that there are other programs
      that are not currently COPAA members. Among the universities in consortium are
      the University of Alaska, Anchorage; American University; University of Arizona;
      California State University, East Bay; California State University, Long Beach;
      University of Florida, Gainesville; The GeorgeWashington University; University
      of Georgia; Georgia State University; Indiana University-Purdue University at
      Indianapolis; University of Kentucky; University of Maryland; University of
      Memphis; Mississippi State University; Montclair State University; University
      of North Carolina at Greensboro; University of North Texas; Northern Arizona
      University; Oregon State University; Santa Clara University; San Jose State
      University; the University of South Florida; the University of Texas at San
      Antonio; and Wayne State University.


      The first doctoral program in applied anthropology was begun at the University
      of South Florida (USF) in 1984. Although the master of arts curriculum had been
      intended for nonacademic professions, the PhD curriculum trained students for
      university careers, as well as for practicing anthropology. USF''s Center for
      Applied Anthropology combines these two objectives in ventures such as the Human
      Services Information System database and the Alliance for Applied Research in
      Education and Anthropology.


      In the 1960s and 1970s, Napoleon Chagnon and James Neel conducted genetics research
      for the American Atomic Energy Commission in an ethnographic setting. Chagnon
      was the ethnographer, and Neel was the geneticist. Their work was designed to
      determine the effects of the forces of evolution (such as the founder effect)
      on small populations in order to determine how genes might affect survival following
      a nuclear destruction of modern civilization. Their research took them to the
      Orinoco River basin in southeastern Venezuela where they established contact
      and conducted research among the Yanomamo, an isolated, horticultural, tribal
      society. Out of this research came Chagnon''s ethnography, The Yanomamo: The
      Fierce People. From its very early days, the project was heavily documented
      on film, and their classic documentary, The Yanomamo: A Multidisciplinary Study,
      became a standard in both cultural and physical anthropology classrooms. In
      the film, Chagnon and Neal become aware of a measles epidemic sweeping up the
      Orinoco Basin toward the Yanomamo. They acquire a vaccine that contains a weakened
      strain of the live virus and conduct mass inoculations of the Yanomamo against
      measles.


      Although their work was met with criticism from the outset, none was quite as
      virulent as the later criticism contained in Patrick Tierney''s 2000 book, Darkness
      in El Dorado, and its aftermath. Tierney claimed that Chagnon and Neel had been
      conducting Josef Mengele-like genetics experiments on the Yanomamo by injecting
      them with the live measles virus to see who would live and who would die-not,
      as shown in the documentary, to protect them from an epidemic. By that time,
      Neel was dead, and although Chagnon was retired, he filed a lawsuit against
      Tierney in which he and Neel eventually were vindicated. Currently, calls are
      being made in anthropology to disband the "El Dorado Task Force" set up to investigate
      this case.


      In the 1980s, Philippe Bourgois conducted field research among Hispanic crack
      ("rock" cocaine, which is smoked) dealers in the Harlem area of NewYork. This
      was not an update of Elliott Liebow''s Tally''s Corner nor of Oscar Lewis''s
      La Vida. Rather, it is what Bourgois refers to as a "culture of terror" that
      exploits an underground economy. Bourgois argues that this renders the crack
      dealers unexploitable by the larger, legal society as they pursue their interpretations
      of the "American dream."


      Across the Atlantic, anthropologists and other social scientists began to influence
      government policies in the Republic of Ireland in the late 1980s, according
      to ThomasWilson and Hastings Donnan, via what are called the economic and social
      partnerships with government. This should not be confused with hegemony as may
      have been the case with the 1960s American "military-industrial complex." Rather,
      in a country in which anthropology traditionally had been practiced by foreign
      scholars investigating semi-isolated rural communities, it was a remarkable
      innovation for anthropologists and other academics to have creative input, with
      their governmental partner, in the policies that led to the Celtic Tiger economy
      in what had been one of the poorest countries in Europe and the social structural
      transformations that allowed the "boom" to filter down to the public at large.
      Anthropologists also have been called on more recently in Ireland to assist
      the government with ethnic minority issues, especially those of the indigenous
      minority, the travelling community.


      Since the beginning of the 1990s, nonacademic jobs for anthropologists have
      increased, and more anthropologists have found themselves involved in the business
      world, especially in marketing, although the irony of this may not be lost on
      those who were students when Jules Henry''s anti-MadisonAvenue research, published
      as Culture Against Man, was a popular textbook in the 1960s and 1970s. Much
      of the new material centers around cultural miscues that corporations and individuals
      make in advertising- physical gestures, slang, and so on-when acting crossculturally
      (e.g., Chevrolet''s attempt to market the Nova automobile in Latin America where
      the homonym of the name means "does not go" or Gerber''s attempt to market baby
      food with an infant''s picture on the label in parts of Africa where labels
      routinely showed the containers'' contents for consumers who could not read).
      Other businessoriented approaches fall more along the lines of the Western Electric
      bank-wiring study (noted above) conducted by W. Lloyd Warner in the 1930s.


      Nonetheless, some members of the anthropological community still consider business
      anthropology to be "colluding with the enemy," according to Jason S. Parker
      of Youngstown State University in a recent article in the Society for Applied
      Anthropology Newsletter. Parker points out that these same critics, who stigmatize
      those applied anthropologists that work in business, are not offering any jobs
      to their recently minted bachelor''s degree graduates, who must then look elsewhere.
      Parker argues that the anthropological perspective can benefit the employees,
      as well as the corporations, through the inclusion of their input in the manufacturing
      processes.


      Ann T. Jordan has written a persuasive argument for the use of anthropology
      in the business world in her book Business Anthropology. Jordan cites a number
      of cases in which anthropologists have ameliorated conditions that had the potential
      to lead to labor disharmony through managerial insensitivity to working conditions.
      Likewise, she explains that cross-cultural conflicts and misunderstandings on
      the job could easily be avoided with anthropological input.


      ## Applied Anthropology Today


      Louise Lamphere suggested a convergence of applied, practicing, and public anthropology
      in 2004. Lamphere argues that anthropologists in the 21st century should collaborate
      with each other, as well as with the groups that they are investigating, on
      archaeological research, health, urban, and environmental topics to unify their
      work on critical social, educational, and political issues. The traditional
      research populations increasingly want greater degrees of jurisdiction over
      what is written about them, and applied anthropologists, especially those influenced
      by the feminist critique, have advocated more collaboration with their respondents
      on ethnographic publications and museum exhibits in order to express more emic
      perspectives. This joint participation in the research and presentation process
      (whether by publication or museum display) fosters skills and generates capacities
      for indigenous change within communities.


      Charles Menzies erects a paradigm to foster these joint ventures based on his
      work with the Gitkxaala Nation in British Columbia, which consists of four stages.
      First, the anthropologist opens a dialogue with the community that may suggest
      modifications to the research protocol. Then, research continues to grow and
      change in consultation with the respondents-who now are becoming "coethnographers."
      Next, the research is conducted jointly between academics and members of the
      society. Finally, the data and results are analyzed by the joint team and the
      reports are coauthored. Lamphire advocates training students to conduct collaborative
      research of this nature as anthropologists increasingly find themselves employed
      by nonacademic public and private organizations.


      21st-century anthropologists increasingly find themselves involved in policy-making
      jobs in areas as diverse as libraries and the army. The University of Rochester
      library hired anthropologist Nancy Fried Foster, under a grant from the Institute
      of Museum and Library Services, to study undergraduates'' term paper research,
      to steer library renovations, and to make suggestions on the redesign of its
      Web site. Foster used traditional anthropological research methods to discover
      that not only are many students extremely uncomfortable with the increasing
      technological changes that universities are forcing on them but also that they
      use the libraries to escape from them.


      ## Anthropologists and the Military


      A recent Society for Applied Anthropology Newsletter reports that anthropologists
      increasingly may become involved in work with the military via a program called
      the Human Terrain System under the Department of Defense (DoD). According to
      Susan L. Andreatta, president of the SfAA, the DoD wants to employ graduate-level
      anthropologists in Iraq and Afghanistan. Opinions on this are divided, but one
      may note that the Society was founded by anthropologists who worked for the
      war effort in the 1940s.


      The anthropologist and senior consultant to the Human Terrain Systems project
      is Montgomery McFate. William Roberts of St. Mary''s College, Maryland, describes
      her argument as one in which a military that has greater understanding of indigenous
      civilians in war zones will reduce loss of life and cultural destruction.


      Also, archaeologists may be involved with the military on sensitive issues.
      As of this writing, archaeologist Laurie Rush serves as a cultural resources
      manager at the United States Army''s Fort Drum, where she works with the Integrated
      Training Area Management unit of the DoD''s Legacy Program to develop a consciousness
      for archaeological treasures. This project arose out of a British Museum report
      that detailed the construction of a helicopter pad by U.S. Marines on the ruins
      of the ancient city of Babylon, the destruction of a 2.5-millenniaold brick
      road, and the filling of sandbags with artifacts. Part of Rush''s program involves
      building models of archaeological sites, mosques, and cemeteries for soldiers
      to train to avoid.


      ## Forensic Anthropology, Ethnic Cleansing, and Political Dissidents


      Television programs such as Crime Scene Investigation (CSI), CSI: Miami, CSI:
      New York, and Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) have sparked an international
      interest in forensics. This, in turn, has led to a student population interested
      in forensic anthropology. Cable television''s Discovery Health channel has created
      a true-life version of the CSI phenomenon with its Forensic Files program, which
      features cases solved by forensic anthropologists, such as Elizabeth Murray
      of the College of Mount St. Joseph in Cincinnati who works regularly with law
      enforcement agencies across the country.


      The ABC News and Christian Science Monitor Web sites occasionally report on
      the applications of forensic science. They describe forensic anthropologists
      and archaeologists who have been involved in the identification of the remains
      of the nearly 3,000 victims of the September 11, 2001, attack; Jon Stereberg,
      a forensic archaeologist, has tried to trace the evidence of 1992 gas attacks
      in the clothing of victims in the Balkans; and Clyde Collins Snow, a retired
      forensic archaeologist, has investigated grave sites in Guatemala, Bosnia, and
      Iraq. Currently, forensic specialists, such as Ariana Fernandez, are examining
      the bodies of Kurdish people who were found in mass graves and who are believed
      to have been massacred in a genocide attack during the Saddam Hussein regime
      in Iraq.


      ## Applied Anthropology and Tourism


      The travel and tourism industry is in dire need of the services of anthropologists,
      and this is becoming an attractive employment option to anthropology graduates,
      according to Susan Banks, an anthropologist involved in the travel industry.
      Too often, tourists will go to exotic locales where they believe that they are
      seeing the actual types of lives lived in those places, unaware that they are
      being fed a fabricated culture designed, not to expose them to life in other
      places, but to screen them from the true ways of life found in those locations.
      Commonly, tourists are discouraged from visiting local towns and actually learning
      something about the countries that they have visited. Anthropology can offer
      a remedy to this problem and provide some much-needed income to the local economies.
      Exploitation and insensitivity to indigenous people by culturally uninformed
      tourists does little to change the image of the "ugly American." Likewise, the
      international sex trade both exploits and victimizes indigenous peoples and
      furthers the spread of dangerous diseases, such as HIV/AIDS.


      Environmental degradation of local ecologies is another problem of culturally
      ignorant tourism. For this reason, Susan Charnley, in an article in Human Organization
      in 2005, suggests a change from nature tourism to ecotourism. She cites the
      case of Ngorongoro Conservation Area (NCA) in Tanzania. Nature tourism involves
      traveling to pristine locations where tourists can experience and enjoy nature;
      ecotourism involves traveling to natural areas that conserve the local ecology
      while respecting the rights of the local cultures and encouraging sustainable
      development. Charnley makes the case for the increasingly difficult position
      of the Massai people since the creation of the NCA and the negative effect it
      has had on their economy. Charnley argues for culturally appropriate involvement
      of local people in tourist destinations in ways that will provide actual benefits
      to their communities. These benefits would include social and political justice
      and involvement in decision-making processes that directly influence their lives.


      A selection of articles from Human Organization from the first decade of the
      21st century includes such topics as the administration of federally managed
      fisheries, including a discussion of the role of James A. Acheson who was the
      first applied anthropologist hired by the National Marine Fisheries Service
      in 1974 to conduct policy research and implementation through conservation and
      stewardship of marine ecosystems.


      Another article described the importance of beer parties among Xhosa labor cooperatives
      on homesteads in South Africa. An article that has to do with changes in gender
      relations and commercial activities, as the global market expands to countries
      such as Mali, explores how the outside world can force local peoples to change
      the structure of their society by giving advantages to one gender over the other
      when that may not have been the case previously. What can be seen as a parallel
      between the popular use of family trusts in the United States in the 1980s and
      1990s and a move from individual land tenure to collective, kinbased ownership
      on Mokil Atoll in Micronesia, as the region''s political, economic, and demographic
      transformation has imperiled the rights of absentee owners. By placing the land
      ownership in the kin group, it is protected from individual alienation.


      A 2007 article by Kathryn Forbes is especially topical in the current social,
      economic, and political climate of the United States today. Forbes''s article
      examines how the regional land use of ideologies and popular images of farm
      workers has contributed to a housing crisis for Mexican agricultural laborers
      in Fresno County, California. Stereotypic descriptions of Mexican farm workers
      have resulted in the formulation of zoning codes that exacerbate demographic
      segregation in Fresno County. Most farm workers live in rural areas, which are
      more economical and more convenient to their sources of income but where there
      are fewer retail outlets-including groceries. The arrival of seasonal laborers,
      combined with a lack of affordable housing thanks to local policymakers, has
      engendered a regional overcrowding crisis for Mexican farm workers. Forbes''s
      role in this discussion is similar to the review of the roles that anthropology
      can play in public policy cited by Wilson and Donnan (2006) in Ireland.


      ## Future Directions in Applied Anthropology


      Forbes''s article is especially relevant to the United States today as the influx
      of immigrant labor, thanks in part to the North American Free Trade Agreement
      (NAFTA), has made the appearance of Hispanic laborers a topic of vituperative
      discussion on national radio talk shows and political campaigns. This is a point
      that falls clearly within the purview of social science rather than politics
      as anthropological demographers and gerontologists clearly can demonstrate that
      not only does the country require immigrant labor because of statistical "full
      employment," but also it needs to save social security from the influx of baby
      boom retirees.


      The bankruptcy of social security was predicted in university classes as long
      ago as the 1970s. The increase in life spans, coupled with the potentially disastrous
      demographic effect of a baby boom generation that will retire to be supported
      by a much smaller (thanks to the introduction of the birth control pill in the
      1960s) birth dearth/baby bust cohort, has the potential to lead to economic
      disaster for the latter group as their increasing social security taxes erode
      their quality of life. The baby boom retirees'' social security taxes must be
      replaced from somewhere-if not by eroding the birth dearth/baby bust cohort''s
      quality of life, then by an influx of tax contributors, for example, immigrant
      laborers.


      Anthropologists are in a unique position to act as the social partners of policymakers
      on this issue not only by means of their demographic and gerontological expertise
      but also by their ethnographic contributions to allay the concerns of the extant
      non-Hispanic population of the United States over its possible perception of
      cultural drowning by immersion in a neo-Hispanic society del Norte ("land of
      the north").


      Likewise, anthropological expertise in indigenous Latin American medical beliefs,
      such as hot and cold, wet and dry bodily conditions derived from the ancient
      Mediterranean medical concept of humors where illnesses were believed to be
      caused by an imbalance of humors; folk illnesses, such as susto ("fright"),
      a culture bound syndrome found in southern Mexico in which an individual who
      does not recover from an illness is believed to have had a terrible fright in
      the past that prevents recovery from the unrelated illness (Rubel, O''Nell,
      &amp; Collado-Ardon, 1991); and cultural sensitivities to variations in conceptions
      of sexual modesty and familial responsibilities will form a necessary component
      in the rapprochement of the two larger cultures although this may be difficult
      in cases of smaller subcultures.


      Other areas for future research in applied anthropology include human trafficking
      (briefly cited in the discussion of tourism); indigenous rights (e.g., salmon
      fishing among the native Northwest coast peoples in North America, cattle grazing
      in the Burren in County Clare, Ireland, or the effects of water control on the
      Marsh Arabs of southern Iraq); anthropometry and gender (in the cultural sense,
      not the linguistic sense) stereotypes and gender rearing roles; cultural relativism
      versus cultural interference, including whether or not Muslim women need to
      be "saved" or if Western hegemonists even have the right to do so; genital mutilation
      (male as well as female); the role of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in
      distributing information and treatment of HIV/AIDS; food waste, diet and health,
      and body image; intelligent design, globalization and hightech industry; and
      the role of biology and culture in psychiatric illnesses, to name but a few
      of the possibilities open to applied research in anthropology.


      In an article titled "Making Our Voices Heard-Ethical Dilemmas and Opportunities,"
      in the November 2007 Society for Applied Anthropology Newsletter, Mark Schuller
      of Vassar College gives a good review of the future of applied research in anthropology.
      Schuller writes that many anthropologists believe that their contributions are
      considered marginal and irrelevant and are passed over in policy making based
      on a review of the leading anthropological journals and newsletters. He argues
      that applied anthropologists with a holistic viewpoint can inform policymakers
      regarding the integrated structural correlation among debt and poverty, education,
      health care, and local welfare via their engagement with local communities.
      Schuller calls for local, global, and ethical analysis of current concerns to
      make anthropology applicable in the "real" world. He suggests that a good way
      to apply anthropology is through teaching; his students investigate public policies
      and then send letters to the editors of newspapers in order to introduce anthropological
      viewpoints into current policy discussions.


      Schuller has been keyword-searching "anthropology" on Google and reports that
      he has found at least two stories a day in which anthropologists are interviewed
      or have authored stories in media outlets. Among the included issues that his
      students or other anthropologists have written about in daily news publications
      is the part played by anthropologists in clandestine activities, inequalities
      of globalization, the State Children''s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) health
      care bill, the UN Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, No Child
      Left Behind, prison reform, disclosure of hormone content in milk, Hurricane
      Katrina "fatigue," and the cancellation of international debt in impoverished
      nations of South America.


      In the same issue, Amanda Stronza of Texas A&amp;M University describes a new
      program in applied biodiversity science, which also will tackle poverty and
      cultural inequality. The interdisciplinary research program integrates cooperation
      between social and biological sciences and conservation organizations at the
      applied level. Research topics are to incorporate biodiversity with local legislative
      policy in partnership among academia, governments, NGOs, and local societies
      in four regions of the Americas.


      ## Conclusion


      This article has explored the subject of applied anthropology. It was done from
      a historical perspective in order to gain a processual understanding of how
      it arrived at the state in which it is found in early 21st-century anthropology.


      A brief definition of applied anthropology was followed by a review of the origins
      of applied anthropology in the 19th century and a history of the field throughWorldWar
      II, the Fox Project, the PeruVicos Project, and Project Camelot. The section
      on the later 20th century led into applied anthropology today and topics for
      future research.

      Applied anthropology is the practical application of anthropological theories,
      methods, and practices to the analysis and solution of practical problems. The
      term was first put forward by Daniel G. Brinton in his paper \"The Aims of Anthropology\".
      \[ 1 \] John Van Willengen defined applied anthropology as \"anthropology put
      to use\". \[ 2 \] Applied anthropology includes conducting research with a primary
      or tertiary purpose to solve real-world problems in areas such as public health,
      education, government, and business.


      In Applied Anthropology: Domains of Application , Kedia and Van Willigen define
      the process as a \"complex of related, research-based, instrumental methods
      which produce change or stability in specific cultural systems through the provision
      of data, initiation of direct action, and/or the formulation of policy\". \[
      3 \] In other words, applied anthropology is the praxis-based side of anthropological
      research; it includes researcher involvement and activism within the participating
      community .


      ## Spanning academic disciplines


      The American Anthropological Association (AAA) website describes anthropology
      as a focus on \"the study of humans, past and present. To understand the full
      sweep and complexity of cultures across all of human history, anthropology draws
      and builds upon knowledge from the social and biological sciences as well as
      the humanities and physical sciences.\" Thus, the field of anthropology encompasses
      four subareas: sociocultural anthropology , biological (or physical) anthropology
      , archaeology , and linguistic anthropology . \[ 4 \] Because a central tenet
      of the anthropological field is the application of shared knowledge and research
      about humans across the world, an anthropologist who specializes in any of these
      areas and enacts research into direct action and/or policy can be deemed an
      \"applied anthropologist\". In fact, some practical, real-world problems invoke
      all sub-disciplines of anthropological theory, method, and practice. For example,
      a Native American community development program may involve archaeological research
      to determine legitimacy of water rights claims, ethnography to assess the current
      and historical cultural characteristics of the community, linguistics to restore
      language competence among inhabitants, and medical anthropology to determine
      the causality of dietary deficiency diseases.


      ## Professional engagement


      Applied anthropologists often work for nonacademic clients, such as governments
      , development agencies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), tribal and ethnic
      associations, advocacy groups , social-service and educational agencies, and
      businesses. It is also not uncommon for an anthropologist to initiate activist
      work surrounding his or her own area of study; frequently, sociocultural anthropological
      studies begin as mere research inquiries that blossom into community advocacy
      projects, and even new specialized NGOs. \[ 5 \] \[ 6 \]


      Methodology utilized in applied anthropology includes, but is not limited to,
      ethnography , participant observation , snowballing , interviews, and focus
      groups . Applied anthropologists also use textual analysis , surveying, archival
      research , and other empirical methods to inform policy or to market products.


      ## Problems and criticisms


      The process of conducting anthropological research and then applying knowledge
      in attempts to improve the lives of research participants can be problematic,
      and is often laced with elements of Orientalism and/or colonialism . \[ 7 \]
      Kedia and Van Willigen describe the moral dilemma embedded in this work: \"The
      ethical requirements of applied anthropology are especially challenging since
      the practitioner must negotiate an intricate balance between the interests of
      the clients who commission the work, and those of the community being studied.\"
      The authors continue by stating that this negotiation leads to issues of privacy,
      ownership, and the implications and purposes of the study being produced (p. 16).
      \[ 3 \]


      Although guidelines regarding ethicalities of applied anthropology are put forth
      by major anthropological organizations-including the American Anthropological
      Association (AAA), the Society for Applied Anthropology (SFAA), and the National
      Association for the Practice of Anthropology (NAPA)-it is increasingly difficult
      to ensure that the high volume of worldwide anthropologists proceed with their
      research in ways that are both culturally relative and sensitive to community
      needs. Kedia and Van Willigen describe the myriad roles an applied anthropologist
      must play as effective resource for communities in need; a researcher must be
      an advocate, cultural \"broker\", evaluator, policy researcher, public participation
      specialist, and research analyst. \[ 3 \]


      There has also been some criticism of the interaction between applied anthropologists
      and government agencies, as those agencies may want to move forward with a development
      project while anthropologists restrict progress studying carefully before supporting
      the project. \[ 8 \]


      ### Debates about objectivity/cultural relativity in anthropology


      The field of anthropology is also fraught with debate surrounding accurate and
      effective approaches to conducting research. More specifically, there is continued
      debate about the essentiality of objectivity in anthropological fieldwork. Some
      hermeneutic scholars contend that it is impossible to remove one\''s own preconceived
      cultural notions from one\''s work. In this line of thought, it is more productive
      to recognize that anthropologists are themselves culturally programmed observers,
      and must always be wary of biases that influence information they receive. In
      contrast, the positivist approach to anthropology emphasizes the necessity for
      an objective, regimented, and scientific approach to anthropological research.
      \[ 9 \] \[ 10 \]


      The multinational phenomenon of female genital cutting (FGC) exemplifies the
      necessity for an anthropologist to account for relative cultural contexts: \"The
      work of scholars who stress the fundamental importance of offering perspectives
      on cultural factors that promote the practice of female genital cutting has
      brought the debate surrounding cultural relativism into sharp focus. Greunbaum
      (1996) notes that analyses that do offer emic interpretations and cultural contextualizations
      are often criticized as bordering on advocacy for the practice\" \[emphasis
      in original\]. \[ 11 \] In these instances, it is imperative that an anthropologist
      not cloud his or her own preconceived notions about health and gender relations
      in an attempt to \"remedy\" a complex social issue.


      ## Scholarly works and organizations


      There are three primary groups based in the US that are founded on the application
      of anthropology with acute attention to ethics and social implications: American
      Anthropological Association (AAA), Society for Applied Anthropology (SFAA),
      and the National Association for the Practice of Anthropology (NAPA).


      The premiere journal of applied anthropology in the United States is called
      Human Organization , published by the Society for Applied Anthropology. In the
      UK, the main journal for applied anthropology is called Anthropology in Action
      .


      The Association of Social Anthropologists (ASA) has a network of Applied Anthropologists
      known as \"Apply\". \[ 12 \] Within the European Association of Social Anthropologists
      (EASA), there is the Applied Anthropology Network, \[ 13 \] which annually organises
      the international symposium, Why the World Needs Anthropologists. The theme
      of the first symposium was New Fields for Applied Anthropology in Europe (Amsterdam,
      2013), followed by; Coming Out of the Ivory Tower (Padua, 2014), Burning Issues
      of Our Hot Planet (Ljubljana, 2015), Humanise IT (Tartu, 2016), Powering the
      Planet (Durham, 2017), and Designing the Future (Lisbon, 2018). Within the EASA
      Medical Anthropology Network, there is also an applied anthropology special
      interest group.


      Under the direction of the Royal Anthropological Institute , Jonathan Benthall
      (author of The Best of Anthropology Today ) created the annual Lucy Mair Medal
      of Applied Anthropology. This recognizes excellence in using anthropology \"for
      the relief of poverty or distress, or for the active recognition of human dignity\".

      1\. Introduction


      Anthropology is the science of man which has two dimensions i.e. academic and
      applied. Applied anthropology has a wide range of scope. The knowledge of this
      discipline is used in traditional anthropology for contemporary social, economic,
      or health problems faced by communities or organizations. Applied anthropology
      also uses the knowledge from other spheres of anthropology in order to identify
      and solve many concrete cross-cultural problems. Applied anthropology, which
      is a sub branch of anthropology concerns with the main problems of cultural
      differences in a less susceptible and more lenient manner to satisfy human life
      across the world.


      Applied anthropologists ensure the survival of at-risk groups by drawing upon
      a wide array of research methods and theoretical approaches to endow individuals
      to jointly discourse the real world problems. Primarily anthropology is divided
      into four subfields viz. cultural, biological, archaeology, and linguistics
      but applied anthropology is also considered as a fifth subfield by many experts.
      They are reflecting the growth of the discipline in professional ground and
      scholarly activity. The importance of applied anthropology is indicated by the
      continuing debate within the discipline over it.


      1.1 : Concept of applied Anthropology


      The concept of applied anthropology was first put forward by Daniel G. Brinton
      (1895) in his paper "The aims of anthropology". According to him, "Applied anthropology
      aims accurately to ascertain what the criteria of civilization, what individual
      or social elements have in past contributed most to it, how these can be continued
      and strengthened and what new forces, if any, may be called in to hasten the
      progress". In 1987, Erve Chambbers stated, "applied anthropology is the field
      of inquiry concerned with the relationship between anthropological knowledge
      and the uses of that knowledge in the world beyond anthropology".


      This field was also used in colonial administrations for the first time by officials
      from some of the larger countries of Europe. They were not anthropologists in
      general but their work required them to gain knowledge for the needs and wishes
      of the native people. In this way, applied anthropology began its career with
      a debatable reputation. In the early twentieth century, the Ashanti people applied
      anthropology in solving their problems.


      2.   The domains of application


      2.1 Practitioners'' role in Anthropology


      Applied anthropologists are involved in many roles such as administrator, advisor,
      coordinator, consultant, archaeologist, supervisor, fieldworker etc. which are
      specified according to the tasks they are undertaking.


      Policy researcher


      Policy makers need information to make decisions on policies. In general, they
      are involved in many roles such as traditional ethnographic research or a variety
      of research techniques in particular areas. This role may be the most important
      and can be initiated at various stages of research process, which is from research
      design to data collection. All budding applied anthropologists need to have
      training as policy researchers as the research function is common to many applied
      aspects.


      Evaluator


      The role of evaluators in a policy research is very special. They evaluate the
      use of research skills to determine whether a project, program or policy is
      successful or the results are effective or not. The main task is to objectively
      determine the worth of something.


      Impact assessor


      It is one of the specialized policy research roles which involve the function
      such as the forecast of the effects of a project, program, or policy. An impact
      assessor generally endeavours to determine the effects of planned government
      projects which are close to the human communities. An impact assessor often
      studies various design substitutions because the information produced is usually
      envisioned to influence the design of a project.


      Needs assessor


      The gathering of data on public program which is needed in looking forward to
      social, health, economic and education program design is the role of need assessor
      in policy research. The process of program design and justification is contributed
      by needs assessor. Its role is more common and closely related to evaluation.


      Planner


      Anthropologists take part in the design of future policies, projects and programs
      as planners. In support of decision makers, they may involve in the collection
      of data and analysis of research. This is a unique role.


      Research analyst


      The role of research analyst is to interpret research results of various kinds
      for decision makers. The research analyst may serve as a supporter to planners,
      policy makers and program managers.


      Advocate


      Community groups and individuals are often supported by advocates. They play
      a complex role which always involves direct political action consistent with
      the community''s self-defined objectives. The role of advocacy is not common
      in itself but it may be part of other roles


      Trainer


      Applied anthropologists act as a role of trainers. They develop and use training
      materials referenced to a number of diverse content areas and client groups.
      They prepare technicians and tools for cross-cultural experiences.


      Culture broker


      The culture broker helps in making the link between programs and ethnic communities.
      This role is appeared to be more beneficial in the field of health care delivery
      and the establishment of social services. In addition to these, the culture
      brokerage is also attached to many other roles.


      Expert witness


      The expert witness works on a part-time basis which involves the presentation
      of research data through legal documents. This role is usually taken over by
      those who are academically employed.


      Public participation specialist


      The need for public input planning has developed a new role known as public
      participation specialist. It is somewhat similar to the role of culture broker,
      although it inclines to occur on a case-to-case basis rather than continuously
      as with culture brokerage. Involvement of anthropology in this role is increasing.


      Administrator


      Anthropologists are often engaged as administrators because practicing anthropologists
      proceed with their career. They have ordinance administrative responsibility
      for the programs within which they work. Being in charge in the agencies, some
      anthropologists have become very influential. The roles of administrators are
      usually not at entry-level.


      Change agent


      The change agent is part of a variety of other responsibilities and is a generalized
      functionary. They work to encourage change as they sometimes take the role to
      carry out as part of a specific strategy of change such as action anthropology
      and development anthropology.


      Therapist


      This is a quite rare role as it involves the use of anthropology along with
      the knowledge of various consultations therapies to treat individuals with various
      problems. They sometimes refer themselves as clinical anthropologists.


      3\. Development of applied anthropology


      Van Willigen (1986) traced the development of applied anthropology through five
      different stages. These are the pre-disciplinary stage, the applied ethnology
      stage, the federal service stage, the role-extension stage, value-explicit stage
      and the policy research stage. The growth of applied anthropology has established
      different range of tendencies. There is a parallel development of applied and
      theoretical aspects of discipline and the potentials of application are used
      as a foundation for the development of various academic programs and theoretical
      research programs.


      The stimulus of interest in new research areas and populations is a major effect
      of applied anthropology on theoretical anthropology. The development of applied
      anthropology is considered to be best in terms of an additive extension of research
      context, topics and techniques. The intervention techniques which have been
      developed in anthropology are not applied frequently today. Rather than considering
      applied anthropology as a reliable pattern of internally generated change, it
      should also be thought of as mainly a product of important external forces.


      4.   Scope of applied anthropology


      There is a wide range of scope of applied anthropology. They have their basic
      goals, the first one is to identify needs for change that local people observe,
      second is to design culturally appropriated change by working with those people,
      and finally to protect local people from harmful policies including destructive
      development schemes.


      4.1 Applied anthropology in good governance:


      The Americans and British took help from anthropology because it provided useful
      information in maintaining effective colonial rule. The confounded administrator
      and the dying Red Indian was rescued by anthropology after a long unsuccessful
      policy which uprooted and eradicated a large number of the native races of North
      America. John Collier, a commissioned officer took a big advancing step by linking
      anthropologist to start a better Indian''s policy in 1933. This step had become
      one of the progressive administrations which were based more on anthropological
      principles. Regular training in anthropology was given to those officers of
      the Dutch and the French who were accountable for the administration of their
      colonies prior to the British and the Americans.


      4.2 Development programmes:


      Applied anthropologists have initiated the study of human problems due to the
      variations in technology which are happening in all developing and developed
      countries. The problems of race have been solved by anthropologists by strongly
      convincing that the mental traits are not related to race. A few of them are
      psychotherapists who are employing the perceptions of the anthropologists like
      Gregory Bateson and others on family systems and family therapy.


      Others are working for the worldwide development by joining hands with the U.S.
      Agency for International Development and the United States Department of Agriculture.
      They are concerned with the appropriate technology, fuel wood shortages, agricultural
      credit, new land development, feasibility studies for dams, livestock improvement,
      bilingual education etc. The significance of anthropologists for the development
      programmes have become familiar only when there is a consistent failure of the
      project planners because they neglect the cultural dimensions of development.
      Anthropologists have increased equality in the distribution of wealth and also
      help in reducing the rate of poverty by filling up the gap between a plan and
      the local socio-cultural pattern of the targeted area.


      4.3 Education and anthropology:


      The work of educational anthropologists involves in classrooms, homes, neighbourhood
      and other settings relevant to education. Anthropologists are often interested
      and involved with various aspects of education. They regard children as total
      cultural being whose enculturation and attitudes toward education belong to
      an environment which includes family and peers. Policy recommendations on education
      are led through this applied research.


      4.4 Urban life and anthropology:


      Urban anthropologists also study the life in city, and urbanization. Applied
      anthropologists propose, design and implement social policy and pay attention
      to social forms and to urban social units. For controlling demographic trends,
      food habits and social change, applied anthropologists also study value - attitude
      systems.


      4.5 Medical system:


      Applied medical anthropologists deal with the diseases and the factors responsible
      for them. They are involved in examining the disease affecting different population,
      socially constructed illness and treatment of illness in effective and culturally
      accepted ways. The spread and distribution of diseases and the influence of
      cultural pattern are mainly examined by those who are specially focussed on
      epidemiology.


      The popularity in contemporary North America is mainly due to the combination
      of methods used in treatment of whole being which are proved beneficial that
      is holistic medicine in the medical system. Using a combination of therapies
      which include elements of ritual, magic and modern scientific medications instead
      of relying only on any single therapeutic approach is common even among urban-educated
      elite.


      4.6 Gerontology:


      Research on ageing in different cultures and designing programmes for elderly
      in gerontology also involved contributions by applied anthropologists. They
      focus on the consequences of the society where the value of youth is admired
      and the increase in number of elderly people to be regarded as problematic.


      4.7 Business and anthropology:


      Anthropology is also applied in business in some key aspects which include ethnography
      and observation as ways of gathering data, cross-cultural expertise and focus
      on cultural diversity. The relationship between labour and employer has also
      been studied to decrease tensions which generally exist between various classes.
      In a common social system, different social manager, executives and workers
      may be categorized as different social groups. People in the society learn specific
      roles in their limited social system through the process of micro-enculturation.


      4.8 Anthropology in sports or Kinanthropometry


      The work kinanthropometry or sports anthropometry is derived from the Greek
      words, kineein means to move, anthropos means human and metreein means to measure.
      It is defined as the application of measurement to the study of human size,
      shape, proportion, composition, maturation and gross function. The application
      areas of this field are used by sports scientist, coaches, physical educationists,
      paediatricians, human biologists etc. In kinanthropometry,the techniques of
      taking various body measurements such as height, weight, diameters, circumferences,
      skinfold thicknesses etc. are equipped to understand human body structure and
      function. Selection of players for various events is done by anthropologists
      through the knowledge of anthropometry.


      4.9 Forensic anthropology


      The application of the science of physical anthropology to the legal process
      is often termed as forensic anthropology. For many reasons such as humanitarian,
      legal etc., identification of human remains, skeletal or badly decomposed body
      is important. Under these situations, forensic anthropologists play very ideal
      role. They used many standard scientific techniques developed in physical anthropology
      to identify remains of human beings and to assist legal officers in crime investigation.


      They also work jointly with forensic odontologists, pathologists and homicide
      investigators to detect a decedent, discover evidence of foul play and the post-mortem
      interval. Not only this, they are also able to suggest the age, sex, ethnicity,
      stature and unique features of the suspicious remains'' decedent. Thus, the
      application of forensic anthropology is immensely beneficial for the scientific
      community as well as for the welfare of the society by reconstructing the past
      events and also helps in justification of the events.

      5.   Applied anthropology in India:


      Applied anthropology plays an important role in India. The contribution of anthropologists
      is needed in the policy of internal reconstruction on social and economic fronts.
      It was realized in 1807 that the knowledge of anthropology for smooth running
      of administration is important when the Board of Directors of the East India
      Company made a formal decision to use it in administration. Francis Buchnon
      was selected to commence an ethnographic survey of Bengal. Since then Risley,
      Dalton, Grierson, Gurdon and many others had been allotted to prepare handbooks,
      gazetteers, monographs, etc. on tribes and castes of India.


      In the early period of census survey, their services were also employed. The
      various problems of the Adivasis and Harijans were highlighted by anthropologists
      like Mazumdar, Dube, Chattopadyay, Vidyarthi etc. and they also recommended
      ways and means to upgrade their socio-economic conditions. Thus, anthropologists
      are supportive in framing policies for the welfare of tribes and castes. Anthropologists
      can do great justice to the tasks of rewriting the reports on tribes and castes
      with the scientific training and skill. The study of generalized value-attitude
      systems can also be helped by anthropologists. The knowledge of anthropologists
      could be long-lasting in progressing the best ways of checking the alarming
      population growth which threatens to upset all our planning and development
      schemes.


      Applied anthropologists have also taken part in other areas other than tribal
      and backward sections. B.C. Agarwal and his band of young and many other devoted
      anthropologists have conducted a founding work for The Space Application Centre,
      Ahmedabad to develop social research plan of programme production for telecasting.
      Satellite Television Experiment (SITE) was one of the largest and progressive
      experiments conducted on human communication and in this type of experiment
      anthropologists contributed depth, qualitative and descriptive knowledge for
      understanding the process of communication.


      Anthropologists are very concerned about many crises of survival in which human
      beings are suffering and anthropologists do not overlook such crises. A number
      of commissions such as Commissions on Urban Anthropology to work on urgent anthropological
      research, on women issues, on food and food problems and on the challenges of
      development have been established by the International Union of Anthropological
      and Ethnological Sciences (IUAES) in response to these crises. Further, in order
      to face major challenges of Indian society, India has also induced such practical
      concerns of relevant anthropology, urgent anthropology, etc.


      6\. Uniqueness of applied anthropology:


      One of the most valuable research tools of applied anthropology is ethnography.
      Anthropologists study the cross-cultural perspective. The perfection in this
      branch of anthropology is mainly due to its holistic characteristics. In development
      works, applied anthropologists take the \`clinical'' or \`engineering'' roles.
      The decision making tools, including reagent information concerning the probable
      consequences of alternative possible choices are provided by clinical anthropologists
      to the client who may be an administrator or a citizen group.


      However, formulation of specific recommendations for the clients is the role
      of engineering anthropologists. Some of those anthropologists were Raymond Firth
      who was more like a doctor who advises rather than like an engineer who builds
      whereas the anthropologists such as Nadel have a preference on social engineering
      as the proper approach of applied anthropology.


      Summary


      Applied anthropology has played a very crucial role in diverse areas. Different
      stages have gone through to develop this aspect. Many expert applied anthropologists
      can take the roles in many fields such as in administration, education, sports,
      crime scene investigation, business etc. In the present context, applied anthropology
      is involved in solving numerous problems and crises. They also help in developing
      the welfare of the tribal groups and many others such as in development of urban
      areas by setting up policies and plans etc. Applied anthropologists are helpful
      in upbringing the future life of the society from different perspectives. In
      effective and good governance, many administrative norms are applied by using
      the basic principles of anthropology. Various rules and regulations recommended
      in educational centres through the applied research of anthropology as they
      investigate the basic traits of the learners which have been encultured or diffused.
      The field of medical anthropology helps a lot at the population level by probing
      the diseases and the factors responsible for it. The problems of elderly are
      also rendered and managed by the study of gerontology which is also a part of
      anthropology. Many ethnographic data collected by the anthropologist help in
      developing and bearing the workers in business. Identifying and selection of
      players in different field of sports usually take help from kinanthropologist
      because they know the relation of body physique with the person''s ability to
      perform in that particular event. Forensic anthropologists play a major role
      in crime scene investigation and paternity disputes investigation. There is
      development of the field of applied anthropology in India too. The scope of
      this aspect of anthropology is very wide that it has supported in many forthcomings
      way of life.

      This article explores the subject of applied anthropology. It was found to be
      most productive to do this from a historical perspective in order to see the
      formation of the discipline from its earliest, inchoate form to its current
      state. This method lends a processual understanding of how applied anthropology
      arrived at the state in which it is found in early 21st century anthropology.


      The article commences with a brief definition of applied anthropology in both
      its broader and more restrictive senses. What follows then is an examination
      of the origins of applied anthropology within the matrix of anthropology, generally,
      in the 19th century. The early history of the discipline through the post-World
      War II, or mid-20th century, era is explored in the next section. The mid-20th-century
      era was dominated by three subjects: the Fox Project, the Peru Vicos Project,
      and Project Camelot, which is treated separately. The section on the later 20th
      century leads into applied anthropology today, which is followed by a section
      on areas for future research.


      Without doubt, some readers will question why particular topics are not presented
      in this article. To them, the reply is that some subjects were considered to
      be just as easily, and perhaps more fully. In other cases, the sections were
      perceived as becoming too large to the point of confusing the discussions. In
      some cases, articles published in some applied anthropology journals did not
      appear to do anything but describe situations without offering practical, applied
      solutions. It is hoped that this interpretation will not be taken personally
      by any authors or other scholars.


      ## What is Applied Anthropology?


      Applied anthropology, in its broader sense, is distinguished primarily from
      academic anthropology as anthropological methods and data put to use outside
      of the classroom. This is not to say that all anthropological methods and data
      put to use outside of the classroom is applied anthropology; field research
      also is anthropological methods and data put to use outside of the classroom,
      but it can be used for academic purposes, as well as for practical application.
      Applied anthropology is used to solve practical problems outside of the academic
      world, and it has appeared under such names as action anthropology, development
      anthropology, practicing anthropology, and advocacy anthropology among others.


      In its narrower sense, applied anthropology is distinguished from practicing
      anthropology. Practicing anthropology is the application of anthropology strictly
      outside of academia by nonacademics; applied anthropology can be practiced outside
      of academia or within academia by academics. To some, the differences are considered
      to be minimal, but to others they are of great importance.


      ## Origins of Applied Anthropology


      Early in the 19th century, anthropology was a religious philosophy that examined
      how to view the place of humans in the cosmos. This began to change by the mid-19th
      century, and people who were to become the founders of what is called anthropology
      today began to look at the more earthly nature of humanity. One of these individuals
      was Lewis Henry Morgan. Morgan, who was an attorney, began to work with the
      Iroquois in the 1840s on legal issues involving railroad right of ways. This
      may have been one of the first, if not the first, application of the nascent
      but as yet still inchoate discipline.


      Across the Atlantic, Sir Edward BurnettTylor, the "father of anthropology" who
      defined "culture," considered anthropology to be a "policy science" that should
      be implemented to ameliorate the problems of humanity. James Hunt, who founded
      the Anthropological Society of London, began to use the term practical anthropology
      by the 1860s, and in 1869, the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain
      and Ireland (this was later to be titled the Royal Anthropological Institute)
      was formed.


      In North America, the federal government formed the Bureau of American Ethnology
      (BAE) under John Wesley Powell in order to perform research that was intended
      to guide government policy toward Native Americans, and in 1879, Powell dispatched
      Frank Hamilton Cushing to the Zuñi pueblo to perform some of the first anthropological
      field research. By 1895, the BAE had hired anthropologist James Mooney to research
      a revitalization movement, the ghost dance. It also was in the 1890s that Franz
      Boas, the "father of American anthropology," worked outside of academia with
      the Chicago Field Museum.


      ## Early History of Applied Anthropology


      Boas developed a lifelong hatred of racism arising from anti-Semitic experiences
      he had had in school in Germany. This led him to attempt to dispel the prevailing
      racist notions of the day in anthropology. From 1910 to 1913, Boas applied anthropometry
      to disprove a basic racist assumption: Cranial shape was a factor of race. To
      accomplish this, he measured the heads of Jewish immigrants in New York City
      ghettos. Presumably, they were members of the dolichocephalic (long-headed)
      Mediterranean race, and indeed, the immigrants tended to fit that pattern. However,
      their children, born in America, were members of the brachicephalic (round-headed)
      Alpine race. Apparently, they had changed race within one generation of having
      moved to America. Boas explained this anomaly as being the product of different
      diets between the parents and their children during their growth years and not
      the result of race at all.


      Boas''s first PhD student, Alfred Louis Kroeber, and Kroeber''s students spent
      the first two decades of the 20th century conducting "salvage ethnology" to
      preserve cultures that were, or already had, become extinct. The most famous
      of these cases, both within and outside of anthropology, is the story of Ishi,
      the last member of the California Yahi tribe, whom Kroeber brought to Berkeley
      to serve as the key respondent from a vanished people. In 1919, Kroeber applied
      anthropological techniques to discover the rapprochement between fashion and
      economic cycles in his hem-length study. He demonstrated that one could determine
      (and perhaps predict) economic cycles by the rise or fall of women''s dress
      and skirt lengths. The 1920s also found Margaret Mead (1928/1973) making recommendations
      on sex education to the American educational establishment in the last two chapters
      of her doctoral dissertation, published as Coming of Age in Samoa.


      In Europe, it was common during this time for anthropologists to seek employment
      in colonial governments: Anthropologists from the Netherlands were employed
      by their government to provide ethnographic data on its Indonesian colony; Northcote
      Thomas used anthropology to aid in administrating the British colony in Nigeria;
      and Alfred Reginald Radcliffe-Brown served as director of education on Tonga.
      Somewhat later, in the 1930s, Edward Evan Evans-Pritchard (1969), in the employment
      of the government of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, spent several research periods
      among the Nuer to determine why they did not consider it necessary to uphold
      their treaty with the British government, among other projects. Also in the
      1930s, Radcliffe-Brown first used the term applied anthropology in the article
      "Anthropology as Public Service and Malinowski''s Contribution to It" (although
      the term already had appeared in 1906 in a degree program at Oxford). Bronislaw
      Malinowski himself, had coined the term practicing anthropology for nonacademic
      anthropology.


      In 1932, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt appointed the anthropologist John
      Collier to Commissioner of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). Collier then
      employed fellow anthropologists Julian Steward, Clyde Kluckhohn, and others
      in the applied anthropology office to investigate Native American cultures and
      to counsel the BIA in regard to the Indian Reorganization Act. The anthropologists
      served as intermediaries between the BIA and Native Americans during the drawing
      of tribal constitutions and charters. Also in the 1930s, Edward Sapir''s student,
      Benjamin Lee Whorf, applied anthropological linguists to the analysis of fire
      insurance investigations, and anthropologist W. Lloyd Warner was hired by the
      Western Electric Company to study worker productivity in its bank-wiring facility.
      Warner employed qualitative ethnographic techniques, such as participant observation
      and informal interviewing, that previously had been used in nonindustrial, non-Western
      societies in one of the first applications of "industrial anthropology."


      The 1940s brought about the efflorescence of the field with the founding of
      the Society for Applied Anthropology (SfAA) by Margaret Mead, Conrad Arensberg,
      and Eliot Chapple. They published the journal Applied Anthropology to counter
      what they saw as academic bias against practical, nontheoretical work. In 1949,
      the name of the journal was changed to Human Organization, and the SfAA code
      of ethics was created. Despite this, Melville Herskovits taught in the late
      1940s that applied anthropology was racist and should not be practiced, according
      to one of his former students.


      Today, a variety of organizations specialize in applied anthropology. The Consortium
      of Practicing and Applied Anthropology Programs (COPAA), chaired by Linda A.
      Bennett of the University of Memphis, lists and gives a brief description of
      some of these organizations on its Web site, including the COPAA , the SfAA
      , and the National Association for the Practice of Anthropology within the American
      Anthropological Association .


      The COPAA also lists regional organizations, which include the Washington Association
      of Professional Anthropologists; the High Plains Society for Applied Anthropology;
      the Chicago Association for Practicing Anthropologists; the Sun Coast Organization
      of Practicing Anthropologists; the California Alliance of Local Practitioner
      Organizations that embraces the Southern California Applied Anthropology Network,
      the Bay Area Association of Practicing Anthropologists, and the Central Valley
      Applied Anthropology Network; and the Mid-South Association of Professional
      Anthropologists. It was during World War II that Margaret Mead headed a group
      of anthropologists who served in the Office of Strategic Services. In addition
      to Mead, Ruth Benedict, Ralph Linton, Julian Steward, and Clyde Kluckhohn, among
      others (including such interdisciplinary notables as Erik Erikson), worked on
      the Committee on Food Habits, the Culture at a Distance national character project,
      theWar Relocation Authority, and others, in order to aid in the U.S. war effort.
      A description of their work and methods was published (Mead &amp; Rhoda, 1949)
      after the war as The Study of Culture at a Distance. Following the war, anthropologists
      also worked for the U.S. Pacific protectorates'' administrations.


      ## Applied Anthropology in the Mid-20th Century


      ### The Fox Project


      In the late 1940s, Sol Tax of the University of Chicago wanted to develop a
      program that would give field experience to anthropology students. To do this,
      he began the Fox Project in 1948 to look into social organization and leadership
      in the Fox/Tama settlement, which was facing acculturative pressures from the
      neighboring Euro-American community. Although they tried to become involved
      in the amelioration of the acculturative process, they had no authority to do
      so. Thus, they developed a theoretical agenda that became known as "action anthropology."
      In 1953, the group consulted with the Fox project and developed a framework
      for action that was funded by a private foundation. University of Iowa students
      joined the University of Chicago group, and together they created the Fox Indian
      Educational Program and began the Tama Indian Crafts industry.


      About the time that the Fox project was nearing its completion in 1952, Edward
      Spicer''s book, Human Problems in Technological Change, was published. That
      same year Allen Holmberg began Cornell University''s 14-year experiment: the
      "Peru Vicos Project." Cornell University had rented Vicos, a feudal estate in
      Peru, as a living laboratory to study social engineering on the Quechua-speaking
      peasantry, to test theories of modernization, and to develop models for community
      advocacy and culture brokering.


      ### 1964: Project Camelot


      Project Camelot had the potential to be a low point in the application of anthropology
      in the late 20th century. In December 1964, the Office of the Director of the
      Special Operations Research Office of the American University in Washington,
      D.C., announced a new program to be funded by the army and the Department of
      Defense. The program extensively would employ anthropological fieldworkers in
      government research for 3 to 4 years. In theory, it was a project that was intended
      to develop a systems model that would enable the prediction of social changes
      that in turn could develop into political movements in third world nations that
      might threaten the United States-specifically in Latin American countries (where
      a field office was planned) but with plans to expand globally. Its objectives
      were to formulate means to predict civil wars and revolutions; to identify means
      to prevent civil wars, insurgency, and counterinsurgency movements in particular
      societies; and to develop a system of field methods to collect the information
      to accomplish the two previous objectives. The budget was expected to be in
      the \$1.5 million range annually.


      Some anthropologists feared that applying anthropology to aid Latin American
      government''s repression of political movements was unethical and would hinder
      development of societies in those countries. A more horrific potential outcome
      to the field ethnographers was the possible executions of their field respondents.
      In response to the outcry from the social science community, Project Camelot
      was cancelled in July 1965.


      Nonetheless, not all social scientists found Project Camelot to be totally objectionable.
      Beyond the satisfaction of the obvious and never-ending quest for research funding,
      which it would have provided, albeit from sources that are suspect to many in
      the academic community, there is the less obvious appeal of ethnography finally
      having some input into government international policy, something that had been
      called for over decades. Likewise, many anthropologists in that era had gotten
      their starts in the military by having had their first international experiences
      during the second World War and their educations financed by the government
      issue, or GI, Bill. Rather, it was the possible outcomes of their research that
      convinced the community to object to Project Camelot.


      Also in the 1960s, medical anthropologists working with the Foré tribe of New
      Guinea traced the origins of a deadly neurological disease, kuru, to cannibalism
      by using traditional qualitative techniques, such as collecting life histories;
      Margaret Mead testified before Congress on birth control and marijuana, and
      she coined the term generation gap to describe a global phenomenon that had
      never occurred previously in human history; Jules Henry''s Culture Against Man
      described the Orwellian nature of popular advertising in American society; Jomo
      Kenyatta applied his PhD in anthropology from the London School of Economics
      under Malinowski to running the government of Kenya, with its diverse ethnic
      makeup, as its first president under the slogan Harambe, or "let us pull together"
      in Kiswahili. Oscar Lewis conducted his "family life histories" in Mexico City
      (The Children of Sanchez) and New York (La Vida) and described the poor as living
      in a selfperpetuating "culture of poverty." Although this was criticized widely
      as an attempt to blame the poor for their condition, it also could be said that
      Lewis was acknowledging the wisdom of people who lived on the edge and their
      ability to survive and fully exploit their economic niches.


      James P. Spradley conducted a Herculean application of ethnoscience to "tramp"
      culture in Seattle in the 1960s to determine the emic structure of the society
      in order to make recommendations for improved treatments to social workers,
      police, psychiatrists, and alcohol treatment centers. It was published as You
      Owe Yourself a Drunk: An Ethnography of Urban Nomads in 1970. In 1969, George
      Foster wrote the first textbook on development and change agency, Applied Anthropology,
      in which he cited changes in human behavior as a primary goal in order to solve
      social, economic, and technological problems. He followed this up in 1973 with
      Traditional Societies and Technological Change.


      ## Applied Anthropology in the Late 20th Century


      In 1974, the University of South Florida began the first master of arts degree
      program to focus specifically on training students for careers in applied anthropology.
      The options available to those students form a wide range of topics that define
      applied anthropology. Among them are archaeology, Cultural Resource Management,
      economic development, educational anthropology, immigration, medical anthropology,
      race, gender, ethnicity, and urban policy and community development. Among the
      reasons for such theoretical breadth is the realization that many master of
      arts students do not choose to pursue a doctor of philosophy degree, and this
      curriculum, then, qualifies them to work in specialized professions outside
      of academia. The reader will note that work outside of academia is known as
      practicing anthropology, and in 1978 the University of South Florida first published
      the journal Practicing Anthropology. Graduate programs in applied anthropology
      are becoming more widespread in the United States since that time; for example,
      the master''s program in applied anthropology at California State University,
      Long Beach, has three program options: communities/ organizations, health, and
      education. Northern Kentucky University''s anthropology program is long known
      for its award-winning Web site with information on where undergraduate anthropology
      majors, who cannot or do not choose to attend graduate programs, can find jobs
      outside of academia; currently, it is in the process of developing a master''s
      program in applied anthropology.


      ## Programs in Applied Anthropology


      COPAA lists member programs on its Web site for those interested in pursuing
      a career in applied anthropology. The Web site notes that there are other programs
      that are not currently COPAA members. Among the universities in consortium are
      the University of Alaska, Anchorage; American University; University of Arizona;
      California State University, East Bay; California State University, Long Beach;
      University of Florida, Gainesville; The GeorgeWashington University; University
      of Georgia; Georgia State University; Indiana University-Purdue University at
      Indianapolis; University of Kentucky; University of Maryland; University of
      Memphis; Mississippi State University; Montclair State University; University
      of North Carolina at Greensboro; University of North Texas; Northern Arizona
      University; Oregon State University; Santa Clara University; San Jose State
      University; the University of South Florida; the University of Texas at San
      Antonio; and Wayne State University.


      The first doctoral program in applied anthropology was begun at the University
      of South Florida (USF) in 1984. Although the master of arts curriculum had been
      intended for nonacademic professions, the PhD curriculum trained students for
      university careers, as well as for practicing anthropology. USF''s Center for
      Applied Anthropology combines these two objectives in ventures such as the Human
      Services Information System database and the Alliance for Applied Research in
      Education and Anthropology.


      In the 1960s and 1970s, Napoleon Chagnon and James Neel conducted genetics research
      for the American Atomic Energy Commission in an ethnographic setting. Chagnon
      was the ethnographer, and Neel was the geneticist. Their work was designed to
      determine the effects of the forces of evolution (such as the founder effect)
      on small populations in order to determine how genes might affect survival following
      a nuclear destruction of modern civilization. Their research took them to the
      Orinoco River basin in southeastern Venezuela where they established contact
      and conducted research among the Yanomamo, an isolated, horticultural, tribal
      society. Out of this research came Chagnon''s ethnography, The Yanomamo: The
      Fierce People. From its very early days, the project was heavily documented
      on film, and their classic documentary, The Yanomamo: A Multidisciplinary Study,
      became a standard in both cultural and physical anthropology classrooms. In
      the film, Chagnon and Neal become aware of a measles epidemic sweeping up the
      Orinoco Basin toward the Yanomamo. They acquire a vaccine that contains a weakened
      strain of the live virus and conduct mass inoculations of the Yanomamo against
      measles.


      Although their work was met with criticism from the outset, none was quite as
      virulent as the later criticism contained in Patrick Tierney''s 2000 book, Darkness
      in El Dorado, and its aftermath. Tierney claimed that Chagnon and Neel had been
      conducting Josef Mengele-like genetics experiments on the Yanomamo by injecting
      them with the live measles virus to see who would live and who would die-not,
      as shown in the documentary, to protect them from an epidemic. By that time,
      Neel was dead, and although Chagnon was retired, he filed a lawsuit against
      Tierney in which he and Neel eventually were vindicated. Currently, calls are
      being made in anthropology to disband the "El Dorado Task Force" set up to investigate
      this case.


      In the 1980s, Philippe Bourgois conducted field research among Hispanic crack
      ("rock" cocaine, which is smoked) dealers in the Harlem area of NewYork. This
      was not an update of Elliott Liebow''s Tally''s Corner nor of Oscar Lewis''s
      La Vida. Rather, it is what Bourgois refers to as a "culture of terror" that
      exploits an underground economy. Bourgois argues that this renders the crack
      dealers unexploitable by the larger, legal society as they pursue their interpretations
      of the "American dream."


      Across the Atlantic, anthropologists and other social scientists began to influence
      government policies in the Republic of Ireland in the late 1980s, according
      to ThomasWilson and Hastings Donnan, via what are called the economic and social
      partnerships with government. This should not be confused with hegemony as may
      have been the case with the 1960s American "military-industrial complex." Rather,
      in a country in which anthropology traditionally had been practiced by foreign
      scholars investigating semi-isolated rural communities, it was a remarkable
      innovation for anthropologists and other academics to have creative input, with
      their governmental partner, in the policies that led to the Celtic Tiger economy
      in what had been one of the poorest countries in Europe and the social structural
      transformations that allowed the "boom" to filter down to the public at large.
      Anthropologists also have been called on more recently in Ireland to assist
      the government with ethnic minority issues, especially those of the indigenous
      minority, the travelling community.


      Since the beginning of the 1990s, nonacademic jobs for anthropologists have
      increased, and more anthropologists have found themselves involved in the business
      world, especially in marketing, although the irony of this may not be lost on
      those who were students when Jules Henry''s anti-MadisonAvenue research, published
      as Culture Against Man, was a popular textbook in the 1960s and 1970s. Much
      of the new material centers around cultural miscues that corporations and individuals
      make in advertising- physical gestures, slang, and so on-when acting crossculturally
      (e.g., Chevrolet''s attempt to market the Nova automobile in Latin America where
      the homonym of the name means "does not go" or Gerber''s attempt to market baby
      food with an infant''s picture on the label in parts of Africa where labels
      routinely showed the containers'' contents for consumers who could not read).
      Other businessoriented approaches fall more along the lines of the Western Electric
      bank-wiring study (noted above) conducted by W. Lloyd Warner in the 1930s.


      Nonetheless, some members of the anthropological community still consider business
      anthropology to be "colluding with the enemy," according to Jason S. Parker
      of Youngstown State University in a recent article in the Society for Applied
      Anthropology Newsletter. Parker points out that these same critics, who stigmatize
      those applied anthropologists that work in business, are not offering any jobs
      to their recently minted bachelor''s degree graduates, who must then look elsewhere.
      Parker argues that the anthropological perspective can benefit the employees,
      as well as the corporations, through the inclusion of their input in the manufacturing
      processes.


      Ann T. Jordan has written a persuasive argument for the use of anthropology
      in the business world in her book Business Anthropology. Jordan cites a number
      of cases in which anthropologists have ameliorated conditions that had the potential
      to lead to labor disharmony through managerial insensitivity to working conditions.
      Likewise, she explains that cross-cultural conflicts and misunderstandings on
      the job could easily be avoided with anthropological input.


      ## Applied Anthropology Today


      Louise Lamphere suggested a convergence of applied, practicing, and public anthropology
      in 2004. Lamphere argues that anthropologists in the 21st century should collaborate
      with each other, as well as with the groups that they are investigating, on
      archaeological research, health, urban, and environmental topics to unify their
      work on critical social, educational, and political issues. The traditional
      research populations increasingly want greater degrees of jurisdiction over
      what is written about them, and applied anthropologists, especially those influenced
      by the feminist critique, have advocated more collaboration with their respondents
      on ethnographic publications and museum exhibits in order to express more emic
      perspectives. This joint participation in the research and presentation process
      (whether by publication or museum display) fosters skills and generates capacities
      for indigenous change within communities.


      Charles Menzies erects a paradigm to foster these joint ventures based on his
      work with the Gitkxaala Nation in British Columbia, which consists of four stages.
      First, the anthropologist opens a dialogue with the community that may suggest
      modifications to the research protocol. Then, research continues to grow and
      change in consultation with the respondents-who now are becoming "coethnographers."
      Next, the research is conducted jointly between academics and members of the
      society. Finally, the data and results are analyzed by the joint team and the
      reports are coauthored. Lamphire advocates training students to conduct collaborative
      research of this nature as anthropologists increasingly find themselves employed
      by nonacademic public and private organizations.


      21st-century anthropologists increasingly find themselves involved in policy-making
      jobs in areas as diverse as libraries and the army. The University of Rochester
      library hired anthropologist Nancy Fried Foster, under a grant from the Institute
      of Museum and Library Services, to study undergraduates'' term paper research,
      to steer library renovations, and to make suggestions on the redesign of its
      Web site. Foster used traditional anthropological research methods to discover
      that not only are many students extremely uncomfortable with the increasing
      technological changes that universities are forcing on them but also that they
      use the libraries to escape from them.


      ## Anthropologists and the Military


      A recent Society for Applied Anthropology Newsletter reports that anthropologists
      increasingly may become involved in work with the military via a program called
      the Human Terrain System under the Department of Defense (DoD). According to
      Susan L. Andreatta, president of the SfAA, the DoD wants to employ graduate-level
      anthropologists in Iraq and Afghanistan. Opinions on this are divided, but one
      may note that the Society was founded by anthropologists who worked for the
      war effort in the 1940s.


      The anthropologist and senior consultant to the Human Terrain Systems project
      is Montgomery McFate. William Roberts of St. Mary''s College, Maryland, describes
      her argument as one in which a military that has greater understanding of indigenous
      civilians in war zones will reduce loss of life and cultural destruction.


      Also, archaeologists may be involved with the military on sensitive issues.
      As of this writing, archaeologist Laurie Rush serves as a cultural resources
      manager at the United States Army''s Fort Drum, where she works with the Integrated
      Training Area Management unit of the DoD''s Legacy Program to develop a consciousness
      for archaeological treasures. This project arose out of a British Museum report
      that detailed the construction of a helicopter pad by U.S. Marines on the ruins
      of the ancient city of Babylon, the destruction of a 2.5-millenniaold brick
      road, and the filling of sandbags with artifacts. Part of Rush''s program involves
      building models of archaeological sites, mosques, and cemeteries for soldiers
      to train to avoid.


      ## Forensic Anthropology, Ethnic Cleansing, and Political Dissidents


      Television programs such as Crime Scene Investigation (CSI), CSI: Miami, CSI:
      New York, and Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) have sparked an international
      interest in forensics. This, in turn, has led to a student population interested
      in forensic anthropology. Cable television''s Discovery Health channel has created
      a true-life version of the CSI phenomenon with its Forensic Files program, which
      features cases solved by forensic anthropologists, such as Elizabeth Murray
      of the College of Mount St. Joseph in Cincinnati who works regularly with law
      enforcement agencies across the country.


      The ABC News and Christian Science Monitor Web sites occasionally report on
      the applications of forensic science. They describe forensic anthropologists
      and archaeologists who have been involved in the identification of the remains
      of the nearly 3,000 victims of the September 11, 2001, attack; Jon Stereberg,
      a forensic archaeologist, has tried to trace the evidence of 1992 gas attacks
      in the clothing of victims in the Balkans; and Clyde Collins Snow, a retired
      forensic archaeologist, has investigated grave sites in Guatemala, Bosnia, and
      Iraq. Currently, forensic specialists, such as Ariana Fernandez, are examining
      the bodies of Kurdish people who were found in mass graves and who are believed
      to have been massacred in a genocide attack during the Saddam Hussein regime
      in Iraq.


      ## Applied Anthropology and Tourism


      The travel and tourism industry is in dire need of the services of anthropologists,
      and this is becoming an attractive employment option to anthropology graduates,
      according to Susan Banks, an anthropologist involved in the travel industry.
      Too often, tourists will go to exotic locales where they believe that they are
      seeing the actual types of lives lived in those places, unaware that they are
      being fed a fabricated culture designed, not to expose them to life in other
      places, but to screen them from the true ways of life found in those locations.
      Commonly, tourists are discouraged from visiting local towns and actually learning
      something about the countries that they have visited. Anthropology can offer
      a remedy to this problem and provide some much-needed income to the local economies.
      Exploitation and insensitivity to indigenous people by culturally uninformed
      tourists does little to change the image of the "ugly American." Likewise, the
      international sex trade both exploits and victimizes indigenous peoples and
      furthers the spread of dangerous diseases, such as HIV/AIDS.


      Environmental degradation of local ecologies is another problem of culturally
      ignorant tourism. For this reason, Susan Charnley, in an article in Human Organization
      in 2005, suggests a change from nature tourism to ecotourism. She cites the
      case of Ngorongoro Conservation Area (NCA) in Tanzania. Nature tourism involves
      traveling to pristine locations where tourists can experience and enjoy nature;
      ecotourism involves traveling to natural areas that conserve the local ecology
      while respecting the rights of the local cultures and encouraging sustainable
      development. Charnley makes the case for the increasingly difficult position
      of the Massai people since the creation of the NCA and the negative effect it
      has had on their economy. Charnley argues for culturally appropriate involvement
      of local people in tourist destinations in ways that will provide actual benefits
      to their communities. These benefits would include social and political justice
      and involvement in decision-making processes that directly influence their lives.


      A selection of articles from Human Organization from the first decade of the
      21st century includes such topics as the administration of federally managed
      fisheries, including a discussion of the role of James A. Acheson who was the
      first applied anthropologist hired by the National Marine Fisheries Service
      in 1974 to conduct policy research and implementation through conservation and
      stewardship of marine ecosystems.


      Another article described the importance of beer parties among Xhosa labor cooperatives
      on homesteads in South Africa. An article that has to do with changes in gender
      relations and commercial activities, as the global market expands to countries
      such as Mali, explores how the outside world can force local peoples to change
      the structure of their society by giving advantages to one gender over the other
      when that may not have been the case previously. What can be seen as a parallel
      between the popular use of family trusts in the United States in the 1980s and
      1990s and a move from individual land tenure to collective, kinbased ownership
      on Mokil Atoll in Micronesia, as the region''s political, economic, and demographic
      transformation has imperiled the rights of absentee owners. By placing the land
      ownership in the kin group, it is protected from individual alienation.


      A 2007 article by Kathryn Forbes is especially topical in the current social,
      economic, and political climate of the United States today. Forbes''s article
      examines how the regional land use of ideologies and popular images of farm
      workers has contributed to a housing crisis for Mexican agricultural laborers
      in Fresno County, California. Stereotypic descriptions of Mexican farm workers
      have resulted in the formulation of zoning codes that exacerbate demographic
      segregation in Fresno County. Most farm workers live in rural areas, which are
      more economical and more convenient to their sources of income but where there
      are fewer retail outlets-including groceries. The arrival of seasonal laborers,
      combined with a lack of affordable housing thanks to local policymakers, has
      engendered a regional overcrowding crisis for Mexican farm workers. Forbes''s
      role in this discussion is similar to the review of the roles that anthropology
      can play in public policy cited by Wilson and Donnan (2006) in Ireland.


      ## Future Directions in Applied Anthropology


      Forbes''s article is especially relevant to the United States today as the influx
      of immigrant labor, thanks in part to the North American Free Trade Agreement
      (NAFTA), has made the appearance of Hispanic laborers a topic of vituperative
      discussion on national radio talk shows and political campaigns. This is a point
      that falls clearly within the purview of social science rather than politics
      as anthropological demographers and gerontologists clearly can demonstrate that
      not only does the country require immigrant labor because of statistical "full
      employment," but also it needs to save social security from the influx of baby
      boom retirees.


      The bankruptcy of social security was predicted in university classes as long
      ago as the 1970s. The increase in life spans, coupled with the potentially disastrous
      demographic effect of a baby boom generation that will retire to be supported
      by a much smaller (thanks to the introduction of the birth control pill in the
      1960s) birth dearth/baby bust cohort, has the potential to lead to economic
      disaster for the latter group as their increasing social security taxes erode
      their quality of life. The baby boom retirees'' social security taxes must be
      replaced from somewhere-if not by eroding the birth dearth/baby bust cohort''s
      quality of life, then by an influx of tax contributors, for example, immigrant
      laborers.


      Anthropologists are in a unique position to act as the social partners of policymakers
      on this issue not only by means of their demographic and gerontological expertise
      but also by their ethnographic contributions to allay the concerns of the extant
      non-Hispanic population of the United States over its possible perception of
      cultural drowning by immersion in a neo-Hispanic society del Norte ("land of
      the north").


      Likewise, anthropological expertise in indigenous Latin American medical beliefs,
      such as hot and cold, wet and dry bodily conditions derived from the ancient
      Mediterranean medical concept of humors where illnesses were believed to be
      caused by an imbalance of humors; folk illnesses, such as susto ("fright"),
      a culture bound syndrome found in southern Mexico in which an individual who
      does not recover from an illness is believed to have had a terrible fright in
      the past that prevents recovery from the unrelated illness (Rubel, O''Nell,
      &amp; Collado-Ardon, 1991); and cultural sensitivities to variations in conceptions
      of sexual modesty and familial responsibilities will form a necessary component
      in the rapprochement of the two larger cultures although this may be difficult
      in cases of smaller subcultures.


      Other areas for future research in applied anthropology include human trafficking
      (briefly cited in the discussion of tourism); indigenous rights (e.g., salmon
      fishing among the native Northwest coast peoples in North America, cattle grazing
      in the Burren in County Clare, Ireland, or the effects of water control on the
      Marsh Arabs of southern Iraq); anthropometry and gender (in the cultural sense,
      not the linguistic sense) stereotypes and gender rearing roles; cultural relativism
      versus cultural interference, including whether or not Muslim women need to
      be "saved" or if Western hegemonists even have the right to do so; genital mutilation
      (male as well as female); the role of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in
      distributing information and treatment of HIV/AIDS; food waste, diet and health,
      and body image; intelligent design, globalization and hightech industry; and
      the role of biology and culture in psychiatric illnesses, to name but a few
      of the possibilities open to applied research in anthropology.


      In an article titled "Making Our Voices Heard-Ethical Dilemmas and Opportunities,"
      in the November 2007 Society for Applied Anthropology Newsletter, Mark Schuller
      of Vassar College gives a good review of the future of applied research in anthropology.
      Schuller writes that many anthropologists believe that their contributions are
      considered marginal and irrelevant and are passed over in policy making based
      on a review of the leading anthropological journals and newsletters. He argues
      that applied anthropologists with a holistic viewpoint can inform policymakers
      regarding the integrated structural correlation among debt and poverty, education,
      health care, and local welfare via their engagement with local communities.
      Schuller calls for local, global, and ethical analysis of current concerns to
      make anthropology applicable in the "real" world. He suggests that a good way
      to apply anthropology is through teaching; his students investigate public policies
      and then send letters to the editors of newspapers in order to introduce anthropological
      viewpoints into current policy discussions.


      Schuller has been keyword-searching "anthropology" on Google and reports that
      he has found at least two stories a day in which anthropologists are interviewed
      or have authored stories in media outlets. Among the included issues that his
      students or other anthropologists have written about in daily news publications
      is the part played by anthropologists in clandestine activities, inequalities
      of globalization, the State Children''s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) health
      care bill, the UN Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, No Child
      Left Behind, prison reform, disclosure of hormone content in milk, Hurricane
      Katrina "fatigue," and the cancellation of international debt in impoverished
      nations of South America.


      In the same issue, Amanda Stronza of Texas A&amp;M University describes a new
      program in applied biodiversity science, which also will tackle poverty and
      cultural inequality. The interdisciplinary research program integrates cooperation
      between social and biological sciences and conservation organizations at the
      applied level. Research topics are to incorporate biodiversity with local legislative
      policy in partnership among academia, governments, NGOs, and local societies
      in four regions of the Americas.


      ## Conclusion


      This article has explored the subject of applied anthropology. It was done from
      a historical perspective in order to gain a processual understanding of how
      it arrived at the state in which it is found in early 21st-century anthropology.


      A brief definition of applied anthropology was followed by a review of the origins
      of applied anthropology in the 19th century and a history of the field throughWorldWar
      II, the Fox Project, the PeruVicos Project, and Project Camelot. The section
      on the later 20th century led into applied anthropology today and topics for
      future research.

      Applied anthropology is the aspect of anthropology that serves practical community
      or organizational needs. In Europe this subfield started in the 19th and early
      20th centuries, when ethnographic information was collected and used by colonial
      Belgian, French, British, Dutch, and Russian administrators. In North America
      the Mexican government in 1917 was the first to officially recognize its usefulness.


      All branches of anthropology have applied aspects. Physical anthropologists
      work in forensics and industrial design . Archaeologists support historic preservation.
      Anthropological linguists have designed educational programs and whole writing
      systems. Some degree of identification with other disciplines , especially sociology
      , is frequent. Practitioners may have supplementary credentials in fields such
      as public health or law .


      Among the many professional groups associated with applied anthropology are
      Anthropology in Action (in Britain), the Society for Applied Anthropology (SfAA)
      and the National Association for the Practice of Anthropology (in the United
      States), and the Society of Applied Anthropology (in Canada). France, Russia,
      and India have government departments devoted to anthropological research, some
      of which has applied value. Since the 1980s anthropologists working outside
      of research institutions at times have been called "practicing anthropologists."
      Applied or practicing anthropologists are almost never licensed or certified.
      They may, however, perform legally mandated studies, such as environmental impact
      assessments or gender analyses, for governments or international agencies.


      The support of policy-related decision making is common to much of applied social
      or cultural anthropology . The typical approach is holistic and gives attention
      to context . Flexible research methodologies often combine statistical techniques
      with participatory, qualitative methods such as participant observation, case
      studies, focus groups, key informant interviews, or rapid appraisal. The work
      may entail service as a "culture broker" or even conflict mediation. Some practitioners
      become advocates promoting specific groups'' interests. "Action anthropologists"
      work as insiders to help manage change and build self-sufficiency. Applied activities
      are rarely documented in widely accessible publications.


      Applied anthropology has made positive contributions to public life. Industrial
      research in the 1930s and ''40s influenced modern business administration and
      management techniques and theories. In many countries, including Australia,
      Canada, India, Mexico, Russia, and the United States , anthropologists have
      helped to negotiate or implement policies strengthening indigenous peoples''
      rights. On a global scale, Franz Boas deserves credit for stimulating the research
      that proved, as a 1963 United Nations declaration states, "that any doctrine
      of racial differentiation or superiority is scientifically false."


      Present-day employment of applied anthropologists by industries such as mining
      (e.g., in Western Australia) shows, on the other hand, that practitioners may
      work against indigenous peoples'' interests rather than for them. Anthropologists
      working on behalf of governments (e.g., Mexico or China) have at times promoted
      an approach to "acculturation" that disregards indigenous peoples'' social needs
      and values.


      Applied anthropology tends to be a controversial pursuit. Early anthropologists''
      claims of "ethical neutrality" vis-à-vis colonial policies were challenged in
      France and Great Britain. Conflicts about involvement in the Vietnam War and
      other Cold War projects created deep rifts in American anthropology during the
      1960s and ''70s. In the 1980s American, British, and Canadian professional associations
      responded to such conflicts by writing codes of ethics establishing minimum
      (but nonenforceable) standards for professional conduct. Ongoing debates sustain
      a wholesome concern about moral and political dilemmas posed by some applied
      projects. Some of the most vigorous critiques are written by applied anthropologists
      themselves.

      ## Visual anthropology


      Visual anthropology is both the practice of anthropology through a visual medium
      and the study of visual phenomena in culture and society. Therein lie the promise
      and dilemma of the field. Associated with anthropology since the mid-to-late
      19th century, it has not attained the status of a subdiscipline with a distinct
      set of theories and methods. Historically, it has been a collection of diverse
      interests and practices, most notably in the use of visual data for analysis,
      the application of film and photography as tools in field research, and, to
      a lesser extent, the dissemination of anthropological ideas through visual media,
      pedagogical and other public interest applications in education , museums, and
      commercial and public media. More specifically, there have been two recent developments:
      the study of all manner of visual representation and communication and, most
      promising though less widely pursued, the attempt to realize an entire anthropological
      project through visual media (especially film) alone.


      Film and photography have been the longest-standing concerns, but ethnographic
      film has come closest to achieving genre status and received the most attention
      and blame. There is still no agreement about the status of ethnographic film
      in anthropology or in film studies. This ambivalence is due to the 19th-century
      heritage of anthropology, representing science and positivism on the one hand
      and humanities , romanticism, and hermeneutics on the other. Add to this the
      dual components of filmmaking, documentation and aesthetics . Initially wedded
      to functional theory in anthropology and realist aesthetics in art and literature
      , film seemed easily adaptable to a "scientific" visual project. Though largely
      ignored by anthropologists, the aesthetic aspects of film were also present
      from the beginning, a circumstance that led to 100 years of misunderstanding.
      Filmmaking and ethnographic requirements are often at odds, compounded by the
      different competencies demanded by the two disciplines-expertise in both is
      rarely brought together in one person.


      Nevertheless, over the past 100 years, a large body of visual work that is loosely
      identified as ethnographic has grown up around the world. Films so designated
      either are made by anthropologists or have significant anthropological components
      in their production or substance. North American, Australian, and western European
      varieties of ethnographic film are better known and more available than the
      significant though less accessible traditions of central and eastern European,
      Indian, Chinese, and Japanese filmmaking. In the West, even stylistically different
      bodies of work have been recognized: from the classic films of Robert Flaherty
      ( Nanook of the North ) to the films of Robert Gardner, Jean Rouch, John Marshall
      , David and Judith MacDougall, and Tim Asch and Napoleon Chagnon, TV series
      such as Disappearing World , Odyssey , and the longest-running Japanese TV series,
      Our Wonderful World .


      Today visual anthropology is home to a wide array of approaches and concerns,
      ranging from cultural studies (with their textual orientation) to new digital
      media technologies-namely, the Internet (with its worldwide reach)-and indigenous
      or intercultural media (film or video produced by members of First Nations \[native
      peoples of North America\], non-Western societies, or those outside the majority
      cultures in Western societies). Some of these new departures rely on visual-aural
      media as the sole and autonomous means of creating and delivering anthropological
      knowledge and understanding.


      Film still has a role in visual anthropology, but photography and other media,
      especially new digital technologies, have largely replaced it. Despite many
      production problems, "ethnographic" films are being made in ever-increasing
      numbers throughout the world, festivals showcasing these films have multiplied,
      and new centres and associations of visual anthropology have been set up in
      many places. With the decreasing cost of new technologies, access to visual
      communication is being democratized. And, with the gradual liberation of visual
      expression from dependence on written materials, the stage is set for the flowering
      of diverse approaches in the garden of visual anthropology, fulfilling the promise
      of an anthropology entirely through visual means.

      as climate change and migration.


      ## Review Questions


      - How does applied anthropology contribute to understanding and solving social
      issues within communities?

      - Applied anthropology plays a crucial role in addressing social issues by providing
      insights based on cultural understanding and anthropological research. By actively
      engaging with communities, applied anthropologists identify specific needs and
      challenges, enabling them to develop targeted interventions. This culturally
      informed approach not only helps solve immediate problems but also empowers
      communities by incorporating their perspectives into the solutions.

      - Discuss the ethical considerations involved in applied anthropology when conducting
      research in local communities.

      - Ethical considerations in applied anthropology are paramount since researchers
      often work closely with vulnerable populations. Anthropologists must ensure
      informed consent is obtained from participants and that their rights are respected
      throughout the research process. Additionally, researchers need to be mindful
      of potential power dynamics, ensuring that the voices of community members are
      prioritized and that findings are shared transparently, promoting trust and
      collaboration.

      - Evaluate the impact of applied anthropology on policy development in addressing
      global challenges such as health crises or environmental issues.

      - Applied anthropology significantly influences policy development by providing
      a deep understanding of the cultural factors that affect human behavior and
      decision-making. For instance, during health crises, anthropologists can offer
      valuable insights into community beliefs about health practices, guiding policymakers
      to create more effective public health campaigns. Similarly, when addressing
      environmental issues, applied anthropologists can help design initiatives that
      align with local customs and values, leading to greater community involvement
      and sustainability in implementation.

      # Applied Anthropology


      Social Science Anthropology


      ## Introduction


      Applied anthropology, both as a phrase and a field of study, refers to the wide
      range of studies, techniques, and findings created and put to use specifically
      to identify, comprehend, and treat human issues. Since the application of research
      and knowledge to social issues crosses across all branches of anthropology,
      it has been referred to as both the bridging discipline and the fifth field
      of anthropology.


      ## What is Applied Anthropology?


      An anthropological approach used to address a problem is known as applied anthropology.
      In use is anthropology. One field that connects theoretical anthropology with
      its applications is practical anthropology.


      Anthropologists have discussed the impact of practical anthropology on social
      interactions, behaviour, and cultural systems.


      The definition highlights the scientific nature of applied anthropology and
      highlights the following −


      - They identified applied anthropology as a component of an interdisciplinary
      team where anthropologists collaborate with experts from several other disciplines.


      - According to them, applied anthropology focuses on comprehending and analysing
      interpersonal interactions and how they might be used to address societal issues.


      ### According to Van Willigen


      One of the most well-known practitioners of applied anthropology, Van Willigen,
      characterised the discipline in terms of its effects on cultural systems. According
      to him, applied anthropology is \"a complex of connected, research-based, instrumental
      procedures that induce change or stability in particular cultural systems through
      the supply of data, initiation of direct action, and other such mechanisms.\"


      ## Approaches in applied anthropology


      The methodologies in applied anthropology are heavily influenced by the areas
      in which it is applied since it is employed in a variety of social contexts.
      We can group them generically as follows −


      ### Sub-disciplinary specialisation


      The teaching of anthropology advanced quickly in the 1950s following the end
      of World War II. In many universities, new anthropological departments have
      been established. Along with traditional courses like social theory, cultural
      diversity, and ethnicity, these new ones were taught. There have been several
      other specialisations introduced, and each of these new sub-disciplines has
      a significant practical component in their curriculum. Many academic anthropologists
      who focused on theoretical issues at academic institutions began doing studies
      on practical issues including assessment, disease, education, and others.


      ### Action approach /Activist Approach


      Action anthropology is a subfield of anthropology that focuses on the investigation
      of action within the framework of anthropological difficulties. Action anthropologists
      are supposed to raise community decision-making bodies to a degree of proficiency
      to address regional issues. Learning and helping are the central theme in action
      anthropology compared to applied anthropology in which achieving the desired
      objectives of the research are the primary goals


      ### Practising Anthropology


      Only anthropologists who work in academic institutions and universities while
      also engaging in applied work should be referred to as applied anthropologists.
      Those who work outside of academic departments and employ anthropological knowledge
      in situations encountered in daily life are referred to as practical anthropologists.


      ## Applied anthropology in Policy Science


      A guiding document that specifies the goals and methods for achieving them is
      known as public policy. They are government-prepared statements of action in
      any area of public concern that lay out the groundwork for public authorities
      to act and accomplish the stated goals of the government for the welfare of
      the public. A good policy process is facilitated by their practical expertise,
      which makes it simple for them to identify the gaps in the development and implementation
      of policy on the ground. In terms of specific research techniques, such as applied
      anthropology\''s contribution to the policy sciences is particularly significant.


      ## Applied anthropology in Business and corporate anthropology


      The globe is getting smaller due to globalisation, and culture is playing a
      bigger part in business and the corporate sector. Today, a large number of applied
      anthropologists work for management consulting firms and anthropological ideas
      and insights from global organisations support them.


      ## Applied anthropologists\'' areas of expertise


      - Culture as the primary influencer of behaviour − Applied anthropologists are
      taught to see culture as one of the major factors influencing how people behave.
      They can accurately pinpoint the cultural influences that underlie every human
      action and behaviour.


      - Empirical and Inductive Approach − The hallmark of applied research has been
      an up-close and personal approach that attaches significance to empirical knowledge
      gained via fieldwork.


      - Cross-cultural competencies − Applied anthropologists are taught to view situations
      from several perspectives and with empathy. Subjective biases are avoided purposefully
      and are frowned upon in anthropological methodology.


      - Ethnographic abilities − include expertise in doing ethnographic forms of
      research and the capacity to clearly explain while taking into account the complexity
      of a setting.


      - Atomistic and holistic understanding − A methodical method of tackling a problem
      by dissecting it into its parts, i.e., the simplification of complicated issues,
      and the polar opposite of it, i.e., viewing issues holistically.


      - Dynamic and accommodating approach − Flexibility in managing new concepts,
      complexity, and the capacity to collaborate with people from many disciplines.


      ## Conclusion


      In addition to explicitly and categorically defining the various techniques,
      applied anthropology also explains why each approach is significant. Since applied
      anthropology is used in a variety of social situations, its approaches are greatly
      affected by those circumstances. By offering real-world answers to people\''s
      problems, applied anthropologists participate in action anthropology and play
      a significant role in the creation of policies and programmes. the need to include
      corporate and commercial anthropology given that globalisation is a reality
      in the modern world.


      ## FAQs


      Q1. What two strategies might anthropological knowledge be put to use?


      Ans. By comprehending Anthropology of and Anthropology for, anthropological
      information can be used in two ways.


      Q2. What are the areas where applied anthropology is used in India?


      Ans. Anthropologists are employed in a variety of fields in India, including
      disaster relief, programme assessment, planning, policy studies, agriculture,
      rural and tribal development, and public health. Anthropological knowledge,
      techniques, and abilities are used to address real-world issues that arise in
      daily life.


      Q3. What are the four significant applied anthropological methodologies that
      are employed in policy research?


      Ans. Needs assessment, social impact assessment, evaluation studies, and social
      desirability and feasibility analysis are the four key methods of applied anthropology
      utilised in policy research.

      Applied anthropology is the practical application of anthropological theories,
      methods, and practices to the analysis and solution of practical problems. The
      term was first put forward by Daniel G. Brinton in his paper \"The Aims of Anthropology\".
      \[ 1 \] John Van Willengen defined applied anthropology as \"anthropology put
      to use\". \[ 2 \] Applied anthropology includes conducting research with a primary
      or tertiary purpose to solve real-world problems in areas such as public health,
      education, government, and business.


      In Applied Anthropology: Domains of Application , Kedia and Van Willigen define
      the process as a \"complex of related, research-based, instrumental methods
      which produce change or stability in specific cultural systems through the provision
      of data, initiation of direct action, and/or the formulation of policy\". \[
      3 \] In other words, applied anthropology is the praxis-based side of anthropological
      research; it includes researcher involvement and activism within the participating
      community .


      ## Spanning academic disciplines


      The American Anthropological Association (AAA) website describes anthropology
      as a focus on \"the study of humans, past and present. To understand the full
      sweep and complexity of cultures across all of human history, anthropology draws
      and builds upon knowledge from the social and biological sciences as well as
      the humanities and physical sciences.\" Thus, the field of anthropology encompasses
      four subareas: sociocultural anthropology , biological (or physical) anthropology
      , archaeology , and linguistic anthropology . \[ 4 \] Because a central tenet
      of the anthropological field is the application of shared knowledge and research
      about humans across the world, an anthropologist who specializes in any of these
      areas and enacts research into direct action and/or policy can be deemed an
      \"applied anthropologist\". In fact, some practical, real-world problems invoke
      all sub-disciplines of anthropological theory, method, and practice. For example,
      a Native American community development program may involve archaeological research
      to determine legitimacy of water rights claims, ethnography to assess the current
      and historical cultural characteristics of the community, linguistics to restore
      language competence among inhabitants, and medical anthropology to determine
      the causality of dietary deficiency diseases.


      ## Professional engagement


      Applied anthropologists often work for nonacademic clients, such as governments
      , development agencies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), tribal and ethnic
      associations, advocacy groups , social-service and educational agencies, and
      businesses. It is also not uncommon for an anthropologist to initiate activist
      work surrounding his or her own area of study; frequently, sociocultural anthropological
      studies begin as mere research inquiries that blossom into community advocacy
      projects, and even new specialized NGOs. \[ 5 \] \[ 6 \]


      Methodology utilized in applied anthropology includes, but is not limited to,
      ethnography , participant observation , snowballing , interviews, and focus
      groups . Applied anthropologists also use textual analysis , surveying, archival
      research , and other empirical methods to inform policy or to market products.


      ## Problems and criticisms


      The process of conducting anthropological research and then applying knowledge
      in attempts to improve the lives of research participants can be problematic,
      and is often laced with elements of Orientalism and/or colonialism . \[ 7 \]
      Kedia and Van Willigen describe the moral dilemma embedded in this work: \"The
      ethical requirements of applied anthropology are especially challenging since
      the practitioner must negotiate an intricate balance between the interests of
      the clients who commission the work, and those of the community being studied.\"
      The authors continue by stating that this negotiation leads to issues of privacy,
      ownership, and the implications and purposes of the study being produced (p. 16).
      \[ 3 \]


      Although guidelines regarding ethicalities of applied anthropology are put forth
      by major anthropological organizations-including the American Anthropological
      Association (AAA), the Society for Applied Anthropology (SFAA), and the National
      Association for the Practice of Anthropology (NAPA)-it is increasingly difficult
      to ensure that the high volume of worldwide anthropologists proceed with their
      research in ways that are both culturally relative and sensitive to community
      needs. Kedia and Van Willigen describe the myriad roles an applied anthropologist
      must play as effective resource for communities in need; a researcher must be
      an advocate, cultural \"broker\", evaluator, policy researcher, public participation
      specialist, and research analyst. \[ 3 \]


      There has also been some criticism of the interaction between applied anthropologists
      and government agencies, as those agencies may want to move forward with a development
      project while anthropologists restrict progress studying carefully before supporting
      the project. \[ 8 \]


      ### Debates about objectivity/cultural relativity in anthropology


      The field of anthropology is also fraught with debate surrounding accurate and
      effective approaches to conducting research. More specifically, there is continued
      debate about the essentiality of objectivity in anthropological fieldwork. Some
      hermeneutic scholars contend that it is impossible to remove one\''s own preconceived
      cultural notions from one\''s work. In this line of thought, it is more productive
      to recognize that anthropologists are themselves culturally programmed observers,
      and must always be wary of biases that influence information they receive. In
      contrast, the positivist approach to anthropology emphasizes the necessity for
      an objective, regimented, and scientific approach to anthropological research.
      \[ 9 \] \[ 10 \]


      The multinational phenomenon of female genital cutting (FGC) exemplifies the
      necessity for an anthropologist to account for relative cultural contexts: \"The
      work of scholars who stress the fundamental importance of offering perspectives
      on cultural factors that promote the practice of female genital cutting has
      brought the debate surrounding cultural relativism into sharp focus. Greunbaum
      (1996) notes that analyses that do offer emic interpretations and cultural contextualizations
      are often criticized as bordering on advocacy for the practice\" \[emphasis
      in original\]. \[ 11 \] In these instances, it is imperative that an anthropologist
      not cloud his or her own preconceived notions about health and gender relations
      in an attempt to \"remedy\" a complex social issue.


      ## Scholarly works and organizations


      There are three primary groups based in the US that are founded on the application
      of anthropology with acute attention to ethics and social implications: American
      Anthropological Association (AAA), Society for Applied Anthropology (SFAA),
      and the National Association for the Practice of Anthropology (NAPA).


      The premiere journal of applied anthropology in the United States is called
      Human Organization , published by the Society for Applied Anthropology. In the
      UK, the main journal for applied anthropology is called Anthropology in Action
      .


      The Association of Social Anthropologists (ASA) has a network of Applied Anthropologists
      known as \"Apply\". \[ 12 \] Within the European Association of Social Anthropologists
      (EASA), there is the Applied Anthropology Network, \[ 13 \] which annually organises
      the international symposium, Why the World Needs Anthropologists. The theme
      of the first symposium was New Fields for Applied Anthropology in Europe (Amsterdam,
      2013), followed by; Coming Out of the Ivory Tower (Padua, 2014), Burning Issues
      of Our Hot Planet (Ljubljana, 2015), Humanise IT (Tartu, 2016), Powering the
      Planet (Durham, 2017), and Designing the Future (Lisbon, 2018). Within the EASA
      Medical Anthropology Network, there is also an applied anthropology special
      interest group.


      Under the direction of the Royal Anthropological Institute , Jonathan Benthall
      (author of The Best of Anthropology Today ) created the annual Lucy Mair Medal
      of Applied Anthropology. This recognizes excellence in using anthropology \"for
      the relief of poverty or distress, or for the active recognition of human dignity\".
